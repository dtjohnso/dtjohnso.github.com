    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://duncanjohnson.ca/Baptist-History/"><img src="/images/2013/11/timeline.png" alt="Baptist History Timeline project" /></a></p>
<p>This semester, students in my <a href="http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/th106-2013/">Baptist History class</a> were responsible for a <a href="http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/th106-2013/project/">group project</a> to construct an <a href="http://duncanjohnson.ca/Baptist-History/">online timeline</a> of key events in the history of the Baptist movement. It has been rather interesting to watch this project develop as the students submitted events and presented their findings to the class. Since my students submitted their final entries this week, I thought I’d share their work, write down my observations on the project as a classroom assignment, and note some ideas I’ve had for ways to use this in the future.</p>
<!-- more -->

<h2 id="thoughts-on-educational-value">Thoughts on Educational Value</h2>
<p>As an assignment, I found that this was a useful project in several ways.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It created interest in the course by allowing students to explore areas of interest. Some of my students said that they didn’t like the class at first, but as a result of the project it was now one of their favorite classes.</li>
<li>It encouraged my students to read widely from the literature.</li>
<li>The atomistic nature of the assignment (30 separate timeline entries submitted in smaller assignments over the semester) was less intimidating than a 10-20 page paper on a single topic. This makes it an interesting project for a survey class, as it allows students with no prior knowledge or interest to expand their knowledge in any direction they choose.</li>
<li>It forced my beginning history students to grapple with questions of significance as they analyzed historical events. In selecting events for their timeline contributions, students had to decide whether an event was truly significant for the grand story of the Baptists throughout history. Sometimes they made good choices and sometimes they didn’t, but the exercise itself helped to introduce them to the basics of selecting and evaluating evidence.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, there are some inherent weaknesses too.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Because it focuses on dates and data, the project doesn’t require the construction of a coherent argument or narrative. My goal was to supplement this deficiency through reading assignments and lectures, and to some extent student performance on assessments suggests that this actually worked.</li>
<li>Because students come to the project with limited knowledge, their choices tend to reflect inherent prejudices and/or emphases from class lectures.</li>
<li>Because students were required to submit a specific quota of events, they did not always select truly significant events. I tried to reflect that in my marks for their assignments, but overall I’m happy with the results of their work.</li>
<li>Because it emphasizes finding separate events, it tends to result in superficial knowledge rather than deep comprehension.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are probably other observations I could make on the effect of this assignment, but this is enough for now. In summary, I thought it was a worthwhile project and a useful student assignment which I’ll repeat in future offerings of this class.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-for-future-implementation">Ideas for Future Implementation</h2>
<p>This sort of project is something I’ve done by myself a few times before. Examples of my own efforts this way can be found on my <a href="/projects/">Projects page</a>. As I review the events which my students chose for their contributions, there are a number of things I would probably do differently.</p>
<p>I have plenty of ideas for things that I could do with this project at some later date. These ideas roughly break down into three areas: 1) pedagogy, 2) content and 3) technical.</p>
<h3 id="pedagogy">Pedagogy</h3>
<p>One oversight in my <a href="http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/th106-2013/project/">project definition</a> was any reference to grammar, spelling, and capitalization. I shouldn’t need to worry about this at this level, but the simple reality is that my students tend to struggle with these things. This should factor into their marks, but it didn’t for this class because my expectations were too idealistic.</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>At some point, I’d like to take my students’ contributions, edit them, and put them into a fresh dataset that represents my own perspective on the history of Baptists. If I ever do this, I will keep the appropriate “Contributor” attribute in the dataset to acknowledge the original work of my students. In many ways, their submissions exhibit a level of passion that my own timeline projects have never had.</p>
<p>If I ever do that, here are some things I would change:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’d place less focus on individuals and organizations and more focus on concrete events. Although many of the individuals/organizations my students selected are important, I’m not sure that representing the duration of some of these peoples’ lives is truly significant for the full story of the Baptists. Some individuals truly were significant over the course of their life, such as Charles Spurgeon and William Carey. Others, though, are perhaps better remembered for a few accomplishments than for a lifetime of significant efforts, such as perhaps Benoi Stinson or Sarah Cummings.</li>
<li>I’d reorganize the events under a more uniform set of categories that are defined in terms of specific chronological periods. At the beginning, I defined only three simple categories for my students: “English Particular Baptists,” “English General Baptists,” and “Baptists in America.” These categories are really only useful for telling the story of Baptists from their founding in the 1600s until around the end of the 18th century. After that, those categories become rather clunky. For instance, “Baptists in America” would probably make more sense if I changed it to “Baptists in America before 1845.” After 1845, I’d need to create separate categories for Northern and Southern Baptists, as well as other groups of Baptists that developed after that time.</li>
<li>I’d edit my student entries to only include the most significant entries. In other words, in producing my own dataset based on their contributions, I’d filter out the submissions that where significance is questionable. I’d still retain their work in a data file that includes all the entries made by that particular class, but not all of those entries would make it into my edited version of the dataset.</li>
<li>I’d also supplement student contributions to correct for lacunae. My students did some admirable work on this project, and in many cases identified truly significant events to display. However, they still missed a few truly significant things, either due to a lack of knowledge or interest. For instance, one of my students included several of Adoniram Judson’s wives, but not one of my students thought to create an entry for Adoniram Judson himself.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical">Technical</h3>
<p>This project depends on code (specifically, the <a href="http://simile-widgets.org/">Simile Exhibit Timeline plugin</a>). As a result, there are always technical things that need maintenance, as well as technical opportunities that could be explored. Someday, here are some things that I’d love to get done to make this sort of project more useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the lens design to include links to copies of the original text of a document when available in a similar way to the wikipedia links.</li>
<li>Implement multiple datasets so the same code can be reused for each class where I give this as an assignment.</li>
<li>Upgrade the timeline code to take advantage of improvements in Simile Exhibit 3.0 (or one of the newer implementations that can be found in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/simile-widgets">SIMILE Widgets Google Group</a>). Apparently there are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4700419/alternative-to-simile-timeline-for-timeline-visualization">other projects out there that do similar things</a> (some of which may even work better), but I’m too heavily invested in the Simile Exhibit framework to be interested in switching to an alternate platform right now.</li>
<li>Develop a better system for submitting entries that supports image upload and supports additional file formats (SVG was a problem). I’m not completely sure how I would set this up. Ultimately, I’d probably need to set up access to Amazon S3 storage, but there’s no way to easily incorporate that into my current system where students submit entries via a Google Spreadsheets form and can immediately see the results on the timeline itself.</li>
<li>Implement geo-code support within the timeline dataset, and then implement functionality to switch between timeline view and map view. Because geo-code data requires advanced technical skills to generate, this is not something I would require students to submit but would be nice to have in edited versions of the dataset.</li>
</ul>]]></content>

    <link href="http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2013/11/05/historical-roots-of-local-church-onlyism/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-05T13:36:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2013/11/05/historical-roots-of-local-church-onlyism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’d like to add a few comments on an interesting debate over at my Dad’s blog about the New Testament’s use of the term translated “church” (<em>ekklesia</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="http://oxgoad.ca/2013/10/22/ekklesia/">one post</a>, he argues that the biblical usage of the term “church” suggests that there is such a thing as the “universal church,” defined as “a universal body of believers that includes all believers from all ages in one spiritual union, the church.”</li>
<li>In a <a href="http://oxgoad.ca/2013/10/27/ekklesia-part-2/">followup</a>, he goes further, demonstrating from biblical texts that the word is also used for what we call the “visible church,” inclusive of the sum total of professing believers on earth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>Suggesting that the word “church” can mean anything other than a “local church” can get you into trouble with some Baptists, and so an interesting discussion broke out in the comments on both posts. In the comments, my Dad asks one question for his local-church-only interlocutors: <strong>“Why is the idea of local church only so important? Or, to put it another way, why is the idea of the universal church dangerous?”</strong></p>
<h2 id="ideas-and-consequences">Ideas and Consequences</h2>
<p>I’d like to suggest one reason why local-church-only advocates cannot concede the existence of the universal church. (Of course, doing so requires that they ignore the plain reading of texts such as Ephesians 1:22–23, but for the exegesis I refer you again to <a href="http://oxgoad.ca/2013/10/22/ekklesia/">the original post</a>.) <!-- more --> The idea that the term “church” can only refer to a local assembly is simply a necessary corollary of Landmarkist theology. Landmarkism depends on an uninterrupted succession of local assemblies to support the theory that the “true church” comprises the Baptist tradition throughout the ages. This (widely discredited) view of history is known as <a href="http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/th106-2013/lectures/lecture-1-theories-of-baptist-origins/">Baptist successionism</a>.</p>
<p>If a Landmarkist allows for a universal aspect to the church, he implies that genuine believers might be found outside of the supposed succession of local churches (the “Baptists”) but within the scope of Christendom (including medieval Catholics).</p>
<p>Because the Landmarkist is predisposed to avoid that conclusion, he must go to great lengths to justify a local-only view of the church. Seen in this light, the local-only view becomes nothing more than part of an artificial perimeter around the Landmarkist theory.</p>
<h2 id="historical-evidence">Historical Evidence</h2>
<p>If the explanation above is correct, we would expect to find the idea that the local-church-only idea in the writings of the early Landmarkists. Today, I ran across some evidence that confirms that early Landmarkists indeed believed that the Bible does not allow for a universal or invisible church.</p>
<figure>
<img src="http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/th106-2013/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/220px-JamesRobinsonGraves.jpg" title="J. R. Graves" alt="J. R. Graves" /><figcaption>J. R. Graves</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>J. R. Graves was not the first to hold Landmarkism, but he was certainly one its most vociferous early proponents. Through his influence, successionist historiography and Landmark ecclesiology became a significant force within American Baptist circles.</p>
<p>In Leon McBeth’s history of the Baptist movement, he notes that Graves believed the church to be “a single congregation, complete in itself, independent of all other bodies, civil or religious, … amenable only to Christ.”<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> He thought that the “invisible church” was nothing more than “invisible nonsense.” In a more extended quote, Graves argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the only church that is revealed to us is a visible church, and the only church with which we have anything to do, or in connection with which we have any duties to perform, is a visible body…. Christ never set up but one kingdom; and if this is visible, he has no invisible kingdom or church, and such a thing has no real existence in heaven or earth. It is only an invention to bolster up erroneous theories of ecclesiology.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>In evaluating Graves’ statements, this quote from Sidney Ahlstrom is telling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of Graves’s argument was a doctrine of the Kingdom which allowed a syllogism to do the work of historical research: the Kingdom has prevailed; the Kingdom must always have included true churches; Baptist churches are the only true churches; therefore, Baptist churches have always existed.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an historical theory, successionism is bankrupt because it is based on an absence of evidence. Likewise, the view that the New Testament only speaks of the local church requires us to ignore clear biblical evidence. It seems to me that the only reason to hold this view is to support the scaffold for the rest of Landmark theology.</p>

    <id>http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2013/03/09/history-of-the-english-bible</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains my lecture notes for a guest lecture during a block class on Bibliology at <a href="http://www.foundationbaptistcollege.ca/">Foundation Baptist College</a> given on March 9, 2013.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But among all our joys, there was no one that more filled our hearts, than the blessed continuance of the preaching of God’s sacred Word among us; which is that inestimable treasure, which excelleth all the riches of the earth; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself, not only to the time spent in this transitory world, but directeth and disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Readers of the English Bible have had the privilege of “the blessed continuance of the preaching of God’s sacred Word” now for centuries, a blessing that is dependent upon popular access to reliable English translations. At the time that the King James translators wrote these words, there were a handful of English translations available to the relatively small proportion of the world’s population that spoke English.</p>
<p>Today, those circumstances have changed. Thanks to the growth of the British Empire in the Victorian era and today’s trend toward globalization, English now serves as the trade language for the world. This burgeoning market of English readers has created a demand for updated translations, and today there is such a proliferation of English Bibles on the market that publishers now use slick marketing campaigns as they Compete for readership.</p>
<p>This lecture will attempt to explain how we arrived at this point from such humble beginnings. <!-- Include some learning objectives and more survey thoughts here about the overall outline of the article --></p>
<p>The history of the English Bible divides into three eras:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Medieval period (ca. 700–1500)</li>
<li>The English Reformation to the 19th century (ca. 1500–1900)</li>
<li>The 20th and 21st centuries (1901–2013)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-medieval-period-ca.-7001500">1. The Medieval period (ca. 700–1500)</h2>
<h3 id="early-christian-heritage-of-the-british-isles">1.1. Early Christian heritage of the British Isles</h3>
<p>The story of the English Christianity begins under the Roman empire. Christian influence can be found in England as early as the first and second centuries<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>, although it is unknown how Christianity arrived. These early Christians were wiped out when the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes pushed the Romans out of England during the early 5th century. Christianity carried on in the regions of Ireland and Scotland during this time under the leadership of men such as Patrick (5th century) in Ireland and Columba (6th century) in Scotland.</p>
<p>Eventually, Christianity reappeared in England in two competing streams. Missionaries from Scotland were first to arrive, establishing Celtic Christianity. Meanwhile, Roman Christianity was reestablished by Augustine of Canterbury (601–604), who was commissioned by Pope Gregory I (590–604).</p>
<p>Celtic Christianity established itself first in Lindisfarne (known as “the Holy Island”), under the leadership of Aidan ca. A.D. 635. The Celtic monks played an important role in the history of the English Bible and the history of educated Europe. The Lindisfarne monks produced the renowned <em>Lindisfarne Gospels,</em> a beautifully illuminated Latin edition that enabled them to preserve the knowledge of Latin after it was otherwise lost in continental Europe.</p>
<h3 id="medieval-english-bibles">1.2. Medieval English Bibles</h3>
<p>The language of the medieval church in the British Isles was Latin, but a few individuals translated portions of scripture into the common English tongue of the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around A.D. 650, Caedmon paraphrased parts of Genesis, Exodus, and Daniel. His work represents an early example of Anglo-Saxon poetry.</li>
<li>Around A.D. 735, Bede the Historian (primarily remembered for his <em>Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum,</em> “The Ecclesiastical History of the English People”) translated parts of the Gospels</li>
<li>In the late 800s, King Alfred the Great translated some of the Psalms and the 10 Commandments into Anglo-Saxon.</li>
<li>From A.D. 955–1020, Aelfric translated various books of the Bible into the English of his day.</li>
<li>In 1325, Richard Rolle and William of Shoreham translate psalms into metrical verse.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Timeline, and this section, needs more detail -->

<h3 id="john-wycliffe-and-the-lollards">1.3. John Wycliffe and the Lollards</h3>
<!-- Based on Cook, lectures 4 p 7 -->

<p>John Wycliffe was the great English reformer who predates the Reformation proper by 150 years and has very little help. He reaches a number of the same conclusions that Luther and Calvin would make much later. He lives from ca. 1320 to 1384, during the time of the Black Plague in England. He lives in a time of clerical ignorance, and desires to teach people to read the Bible for themselves. This is also during the period of the Babylonian Captivity of the papacy.</p>
<p>He gained his degree from Oxford, and preaches against the pope as the Anti-Christ at a young age. He writes a number of tracts against the pope, and sends young men to go from town to town to preach his doctrines. They were called the Lollards. One reason he was successful was his patronage of John of Gaunt, a relative of the King. In 1381 he drew up 12 theses declaring that the doctrine of the RCC was unscriptural, and then he began to translate the Bible into English. He did not know Greek and Hebrew, so he translated from the Latin.</p>
<p>Wycliffe’s theology can be found in his <em>Summa Theologica.</em> His core beliefs were as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The church consists of the elect. This was a novel concept to the church, which viewed all as subject to the pope.</li>
<li>He viewed the papacy as the anti-christ.</li>
<li>He viewed the priesthood as scandalous and immoral and incapable of effecting salvation.</li>
<li>Transubstantiation is a myth.</li>
<li>The scriptures are of supreme authority.</li>
</ol>
<p>He was very literal in his translation of scripture. He was more successful in Bohemia because of John Huss than he was in England. The Lollards were interesting people who would leave sections of the Scriptures in different villages. In 1401, Parliament passed an act aimed at the Lollards that gave the right to the civil authorities to burn heretics at the stake. Eventually, the Lollards who remained were incorporated into the Puritan movement. They were opposed to images, pilgrimages, etc.</p>

<!-- Brent Cook, lectures 5 p 7: -->

<p>Tyndale came from an obscure childhood. The one note we have from his youth is that while young he had read that King Alfred had produced a translation of the Bible. He went to Oxford, unlike the others. He was disturbed that he was not encouraged to read the Scriptures. He complained that they were not allowed to look at the Scriptures until after 8 or 9 years of indoctrination in doctrines which prevented understanding of the Bible. In 1516, he came to Cambridge. He probably joined the meetings at the White Horse Inn. He later became a private tutor for Sir John Walsh of Gloucestershire. He seems to have convinced Sir John that a good translation of the Bible was necessary.</p>
<p>He went outdoors to preach in the open air, and discovered that the Catholics created a rumor about him and attempted to ruin him. Distressed, he returned to Cambridge where he met an old scholar named William Latimer (no relation to Hugh). Latimer said to him: “Do you not know that the Pope is very anti-Christ, whom the Scriptures speaketh of? But beware of what you say, for if you say so publicly you will lose your life.” Tyndale never overcame this.</p>
<p>He was convinced that what England needed was a new translation of the Scripture. He found a man named Humphrey Monmouth who was interested in a translation of the Scripture and supported him. However, Monmouth advised him that England was not the best place to produce a translation. In 1524, Tyndale left all his goods with Monmouth and set sail for Hamburg. He did not know it, but he would never return. He is hard to track down at this point, because he is forever on the run. He printed Bibles in Cologne, but then quickly fled to Worms where he produced his first edition of the New Testament. He found German merchants who were all too glad to smuggle his Bibles into England. Eventually he wound up in Antwerp on the coast where it was easier to smuggle the Bibles back to England. In 1526 Bishop Tunstall ordered that all Tyndale Bibles were to be burned. It was too little too late. He wrote many other works, commentaries, The Obedience of a Christian Man, The Practice of the Prelates, and a great Dialogue with Thomas More. In all, he produced three editions of the New Testament until 1535. He then fell victim to a plot to lure him out of hiding. He was imprisoned in the Low Countries and ignored. Here he died on October 6, 1536. He was strangled and then his body burned at the stake. His last words, as they come down to us, were “Lord, Open the King of England’s eyes.” Ironically, his third edition was printed on the King’s press in England. Approximately 4/5 of this translation made it into the KJV.</p>
<h3 id="the-king-james-bible">2.2. The King James Bible</h3>
<p>The KJV was produced during the reign of James I of England. James I was already James VI of Scotland. His reign over England and Scotland lasted from the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 to his death in 1625.</p>
<p>At his ascension, England was plagued with a variety of problems, and there was religious unrest between the Calvinist Puritans and the Catholics. The Calvinists and Puritans thought he would favor them since he was Scottish after all. The Catholics thought he would favor them because his mother Mary was a good Catholic. In reality, the side he took was his own. He believed in the “divine right” of the monarchy, whereby the authority of the despot is directly given by God and he cannot be questioned. This view is that God ordained human government in the person of an individual king who is responsible for the nation. We see this view expressed in the actions of Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury during this time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tension between the prelates of the official church and the Puritans grew during James’s reign. In 1604, Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, had a series of canons approved in which it was affirmed that episcopal hierarchy was an institution of divine origin, and that without it there could be no true church. This implied a rejection of the many Protestant churches on the Continent that had no bishops, and therefore Puritans saw in it a step towards breaking away from Protestant ties in order to reintroduce Catholicism in England. Besides this, several other canons approved on the archbishop’s insistence were clearly directed against Puritans.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story of the KJV begins when the Puritans came to James in 1604 with a “Millenary Petition” asking to move England in a Protestant direction. They hoped to establish Presbyterianism, institute freedom of worship, etc. They met him at the Hampton Court, and he refused all their requests (except the production of the <em>Authorized Version</em>).</p>
<p>James was not involved in the work of translation himself, but he did take an interest in it. Shortly after Hampton Court he instructed Archbishop Richard Bancroft (no friend of the Puritans, as we have seen) to contact all English churchmen requesting that they seek church positions for the translators, thus assuring them an income.</p>

<p>Right trusty and well beloved, we greet you well. Whereas we have appointed certain learned men, to the number of 4 and 50, for the translating of the Bible, and in this number, divers of them have either no ecclesiastical preferment at all, or else so very small, as the same is far unmeet for men of their deserts and yet we in ourself in any convenient time cannot well remedy it, therefor we do hereby require you, that presently you write in our name as well to the Archbishop of York, as to the rest of the bishops of the province of Cant.[erbury] signifying unto them, that we do well, and straitly charge everyone of them … that (all excuses set apart) when we prebend or parsonage … shall next upon any occasion happen to be void … we may commend for the same some such of the learned men, as we shall think fit to be preferred unto it … Given unto our signet at our palace of West.[minister] on 2 and 20 July , in the 2nd year of our reign of England, France, and of Ireland, and of Scotland xxxvii.“<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="translation-process">2.2.1. Translation process</h4>
<p>The work of translation took place in two stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A Translation Committee translated sections of the Bible from 1604–1608.</li>
<li>The completed translation was evaluated by a General Committee of Review from 1609–1611.</li>
<li>The original printing of the Authorized Version was published by Robert Barker, the King’s Printer, in 1611 as a complete folio Bible. It was sold looseleaf for ten shillings, or bound for twelve.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="publication-history">2.2.2. Publication history</h4>
<p>By current standards, seventeenth-century book printing appears informal and unstandardized, and the early production history of the KJV includes a variety of well-known printer’s errors. These errors ranged in severity from comical typos (such as the “Printer’s Bible” and “Vinegar Bible”) to serious omissions (such as the “Wicked Bible”).</p>
<p>The publication history of the KJV can also be divided into stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>KJV produced by the King’s Printer (1612–1617).</strong> “This short period sees no fewer than thirty printings of the KJB. Careless mistakes continue to be found and deliberate changes start to creep in.”<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>KJV produced by the Cambridge and Oxford University Presses (1629–1760).</strong> “This period marks the transition in the printing rights from the King’s Printer to the hands of the two university presses. it is a period in which the commercial benefits of being scholarly were occasionally realized. Both Oxford and Cambridge published two major editions (cambridge, 1629 and 1638; Oxford, 1675 and 1679). the great care of the editors of the cambridge editions contrasts sharply with that of the King’s Printer.”<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Attempts to standardize the KJV text (1762–1769).</strong> “By the mid-eighteenth century the wide variation in the various modernized reprints of the KJB, combined with all the notorious misprints, had reached the proportion of a scandal. eventually, the Universities of Oxford (Benjamin Blayney in 1769) and Cambridge (F. S. Parris in 1762) both sought to produce an updated standard text.”<sup><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7">7</a></sup> Eventually, the Oxford standardization by Blayney became the accepted standard for the KJV text.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edited by Benjamin Blayney, the 1769 edition sought to overcome the numerous variants introduced by printing errors since 1611 and has since become the text of all modern editions of the KJV. To understand the types of changes Blayney made, consider these passages from the 1611 and 1769 text below (examples from Wikipedia).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 13:1-3 (1611)</strong> <sup>1</sup> Though I speake with the tongues of men &amp; of Angels, and haue not charity, I am become as sounding brasse or a tinkling cymbal. <sup>2</sup> And though I haue the gift of prophesie, and vnderstand all mysteries and all knowledge: and though I haue all faith, so that I could remooue mountaines, and haue no charitie, I am nothing. <sup>3</sup> And though I bestowe all my goods to feede the poore, and though I giue my body to bee burned, and haue not charitie, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 13:1-3 (1769)</strong> <sup>1</sup> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. <sup>2</sup> And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. <sup>3</sup> And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The KJV eventually became the dominant English text. Wong notes that Blayney’s edition became dominant shortly after publication:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, almost all printings of the KJB have derived from the 1769 Oxford text—generally without Blayney’s variant notes and cross references, and commonly excluding the Apocrypha.<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>[<em>Note:</em> The material in this section has been updated in my newer post on <a href="/blog/2013/12/15/the-history-of-the-english-bible-since-the-20th-century/">The History of the English Bible Since the 20th Century</a>]</p>
<p>Around the turn of the 19th century, a consensus began to develop that the archaic language of the KJV needed updating. This produced a number of different attempts to either 1) revise the KJV itself, or 2) produce a new translation using more contemporary English. Some of the more prominent attempts under each of these categories are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed revisions of the KJV
<ol type="1">
<li>British Revised Version (RV; 1881–1885)</li>
<li>American Standard Version (ASV; 1901)</li>
<li>Revised Standard Version (RSV; 1952)</li>
<li>New King James Version (NKJV; 1982)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Fresh translations
<ol type="1">
<li>Jerusalem Bible (1966)</li>
<li>New American Bible and New English Bible (1970)</li>
<li>New American Standard Bible (1971)</li>
<li>Good News Bible (Today’s English Version; 1976)</li>
<li>New International Version (1978; minor update 1984)</li>
<li>New Jerusalem Bible (1985)</li>
<li>New Revised Standard Version (1990)</li>
<li>Update to the NASB (1995)</li>
<li>English Standard Version (2001)</li>
