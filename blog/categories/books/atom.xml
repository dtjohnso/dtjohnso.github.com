    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just yesterday, a plagiarism incident was exposed that should cause all Christ’s church to pause and lament. And no, I’m not talking about whatever Melania Trump said at the Republican National Convention (which I didn’t watch)—though I partly wish I were instead.</p>
<p>The sad story I have in mind is <a href="http://www.eerdmans.com/Pages/Item/59043/Commentary-Statement.aspx">here on the Eerdmans website</a>, and I also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160816191752/http://www.eerdmans.com/Pages/Item/59043/Commentary-Statement.aspx">put a copy of it here on archive.org</a>. The press release states that respected New Testament scholar Peter T. O’Brien seems to have committed unintentional (but significant) plagiarism in his recent commentary on Hebrews and also (though to a lesser degree) in his works on Ephesians and Philippians. As a result, Eerdmans is taking all three titles out of print and offering credit to those who own copies. The author himself freely admits his error and issues an unqualified apology in the statement.</p>
<p>I’d like to use this incident to speak to the issue of pastoral ethics. Since I am writing so soon after hearing this news, I do not pretend to have reached a settled conclusion on all of the questions involved. But the exercise is important, I think, painful though it be.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest question here is what we should now do with O’Brien’s books. My own gut reaction, and that of many friends I’ve asked who are in pastoral ministry, is that while we certainly wouldn’t want to cite O’Brien’s work for academic research, we could probably still use it to study the biblical text personally and for preaching. Last night, I printed a copy of the Eerdmans statement to stick in the front of each book (I actually own <em>all three</em> of the discontinued titles), and wondered if I could just leave it at that.</p>
<p>But I’m not sure doing so fully appreciates what is actually at stake. Significantly, the Eerdmans statement does not tell us <em>what</em> material in these works has been plagiarised from <em>whom.</em> <a href="https://seanfwinter.com/2016/08/16/on-commentaries-and-plagiarism/">Sean Winter goes as far as to suggest an example in this post</a>, but as he also notes, the important question now is “what ought to happen to the various copies of these works that are still available to students in university and seminary libraries.”</p>
<p>I suspect that the results of the inquiry have been withheld at least partially because it is about the only thing Eerdmans can do to preserve something of O’Brien’s otherwise worthy reputation. (As an example of the respect with which O’Brien is held in the scholarly community, consider that he was honored with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gospel-Nations-Perspectives-Pauls-Mission/dp/0830815570">a Festschrift</a> including contributions from heavyweights such as D. A. Carson, Moisés Silva, Graeme Goldsworthy, and others.) Of course, it’s not really our business anyway, but not knowing what came from where creates other problems for us.</p>
<p>Certainly the ideas in these commentaries can still help us to understand the biblical text as we produce an exegetical sermon. But knowing that the commentary contains plagiarism means that, effectively, we cannot properly attribute any statement in these works to the original source. In other words, as long as I know that there is an attribution problem with these commentaries, I simply can’t cite anything from them and consider that to be a proper acknowledgment of the original source. Verbally acknowledging O’Brien as the source of an idea or statement would undermine my credibility to those who know about the problems in these works.</p>
<p>An important, and frightening, thing here is that merely changing a few words while preserving the basic structure and argument of a quoted source is not enough to avoid plagiarism. If your idea is not original to you, then you are responsible to show where you got it, unless it is demonstrable that your idea is “common knowledge.” A couple helpful resources for understanding what is (and isn’t) plagiarism include Andy Naselli’s <a href="http://andynaselli.com/on-plagiarism-an-interview-with-justin-taylor">interview with Justin Taylor</a> and <a href="http://www.plagiarism.org/plagiarism-101/what-is-plagiarism">this page on plagiarism.org</a>. I will not repeat these ideas here any further because doing so isn’t necessary. Oddly, though the definition of plagiarism may formally be “common knowledge,” it is also commonly misunderstood.</p>
<p>It’s certainly true that citation standards are somewhat different (at least in form) for sermons than in standard academic writing. But I believe that faithful preachers should still give some form of credit where it is due, even if it’s somewhat indirect—i.e., while I might say “as one commentator has said,” I would most definitely cite it in my written manuscript with something like, “(O’Brien, <em>Ephesians</em>, 323).” Even here I am not the first person to suggest this. The form of the words in this paragraph are my own, but <a href="http://preachingandpreachers.com/2016/06/24/stop-thief-should-i-have-put-that-in-quotes/">the idea probably comes from this post by Kerry McGonigal</a>—I honestly don’t even know.</p>
<p>And as we know, plagiarism in sermons is another huge problem of its own. I have heard of preachers who may have re-used sermon outlines from others without attribution. In my own experience, I remember approximately where I was in the pew when a guest preacher’s message suddenly seemed unusually eloquent—and after Googling a few of the key words that I had just heard on my smartphone, it was obvious that this preacher had lifted (without verbal acknowledgment) four or five paragraphs from a well-known blog. (For this and other reasons, I’ve stopped bringing my phone to church most Sunday mornings.)</p>
<p>So what should a conscientious (but also busy) pastor do? Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even when sermon preparation time is limited, consult multiple sources to avoid depending too much on the insights of one author. You already know that, but I know the very real pressure that comes from the fact that “Sunday is always coming.”</li>
<li>Use your own words as much as possible. If you can’t explain what your source says in your own words, you probably don’t understand the original idea that well anyway. (Although it’s true that often your source will express the idea better.)</li>
<li>When quoting or using another’s idea, acknowledge your source in some form verbally and in your written notes. You simply can’t be too careful, <a href="https://twitter.com/between2worlds/status/765395373653233665">as Justin Taylor has said</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> These days, there are <a href="https://blog.logos.com/2016/06/avoid-plagiarism-sermons-papers/">many</a> <a href="http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/zotero/2014/10/30/creating-citations-zotero.html">tools</a> available to make this easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preachers of the Bible which commands that “you shall not steal” (Exod. 20:15 ESV) should be especially careful to properly acknowledge their sources. May God help us all to faithfully do that, and forgive us for the words we may have stolen unawares.</p>

<p>Smart, Robert Davis, Michael A. G. Haykin, and Ian Hugh Clary, eds. <em>Pentecostal Outpourings: Revival and the Reformed Tradition.</em> Grand Rapids, MI: Reformation Heritage Books, 2016. ISBN 9781601784339. 280 pages.</p>
<p>Nearly all Christians say that they desire “true revival,” but few agree on what that phrase means. Evangelicals sometimes distinguish between “revival” and “reformation,” associating the former with individual spiritual renewal (usually through mass conversions) and the latter with outward societal change. Furthermore, many evangelicals will contrast “true (or genuine) revival” with “false revival.” Iain Murray captures this contrast in his well-known work entitled <em>Revival and Revivalism.</em> What is it that distinguishes between true revival and the excesses of revivalism? Should Christians pray for revival? How should they seek it, and what should they expect when it comes?</p>
<p>These questions are particularly vexing for those within the Reformed tradition. <em>Pentecostal Outpourings: Revival and the Reformed Tradition</em> brings together a coterie of Reformed historians to argue that true revival is not merely compatible with Calvinistic theology, but that historical revivals have been heavily influenced by Reformed preaching and represents a consistent understanding of the true gospel. Despite the real and lasting results of these revivals, the historical record is difficult to interpret because true revivals have often included mixed reports of unnerving enthusiasm or manipulative revivalistic tactics. Parsing these confusing elements requires a foundational understanding of true revival, defined as follows by Robert Davis Smart in the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pentecostal Outpourings</em> demonstrates that revival is a sovereign gift from God in which, for a special season, His normal and true work of advancing His kingdom is sped up or quickened so that more is accomplished through His servants in a shorter period of time. Revivals cannot be merited by us but have been secured by another—Jesus Christ. Jesus tells His disciples that His righteous life and atoning death won for us “the promise of My Father” (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4). When Jesus ascended to the Father and sat down at the right hand of God, He poured out His Holy Spirit at Pentecost. This once-for-all historical and redemptive event was not the last time Christ poured out His Spirit in redemptive history. Subsequent outpourings of the Holy Spirit, working by and with the Word, are reviewed in this volume in order that we may seek God earnestly to revive His church once again soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each chapter in <em>Pentecostal Outpourings</em> focuses on the history of revivals within a particular area and denominational tradition and is written by a specialist. As a result, the chapters provide detailed and reliable historical scholarship tracing the impact of revivals, usually beginning with the “Evangelical Revival” or “Great Awakening” and carrying forward through twentieth century. In some cases, chapters conclude with an extended theological analysis of the historical events (<em>e.g.</em>, the chapter by Eifon Evans on the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists). Each well-written chapter includes numerous historical examples from individual conversion narratives, the writings of revival preachers, and contemporary historical records. A few of these memorable stories include the remarkable revival stirred by the harsh preaching of “crazy James Glendinning” in Ireland, the eventual misappropriation of Jonathan Edwards’s revival apologetic by later revivalists, and Andrew Fuller’s growth out of hyper-Calvinism to the zealously evangelistic Calvinism that eventually led to William Carey’s missionary endeavors. Of course, these are but a few highlights, and the time would fail me to tell you about the countless ordinary believers who came to lasting faith in Christ through the revival preaching that is recounted in this volume. To fully appreciate these revival stories, you just have to read the book.</p>
<p>Many similarities stand out in these accounts of revivals which took place in vastly different locations, among divergent denominational traditions, and at different times. It is immediately obvious that true revival is no respecter of denominations. It occurs, often without warning or harbinger, wherever and whenever God pleases according to His sovereign plan. Genuine and lasting revival cannot be manufactured, yet many times it does occur amongst people who have earnestly prayed for it. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to distinguish between true revival and excessive emotional enthusiasm, which many times occur simultaneously. Careful pastors who are aware of this repeatedly seek to steer their people towards the Scriptures in an effort to curb excesses.</p>
<p>Those who read this book will be forced to reflect on their own relationship to God’s providential work. Evangelical Christians will come away from this work with a renewed longing for genuine revival, resulting in earnest prayer and renewed passion for faithful preaching and teaching of the Bible. But I suspect that even readers who are not evangelicals may be drawn to this volume, perhaps curious about evangelical claims of divine intervention. Although this book alone won’t be sufficient to overcome agnostic doubts, such readers will find such striking similarities in the genuine revival accounts that they may be driven further in a search to evaluate the claims of the Christian gospel itself.</p>

<p>Starting in January, I’ll be teaching through the books of Galatians and Romans in my adult Sunday School class at my church. This post is an expanded version of a blurb I wrote about the class for a church bulletin.</p>
<p>Paul’s letters to the Galatians and the Romans focus on the essential core of the gospel message—salvation as justification by faith alone. In Galatians, Paul describes the believer’s new life in Christ as a result of our co-crucifixion on the cross of our loving savior Christ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>ESV</sup> <strong>Gal. 2:20</strong> I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romans expands this theme, giving us a theology of the cross that allows us to be “justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Rom 3:24). Because God’s righteous wrath for our sins has been poured out on Christ as our sinless substitute, His justice is satisfied and He has passed over our guilt (Rom 3:25).</p>
<p>Focused as they are on the gospel of grace in Christ, these two books have had immeasurable influence on Christian theology throughout the history of the church. Beginning in January, my Sunday School class will begin with a study of Galatians which will take us until Easter, and then we will begin working through Romans (which will take us until at least mid-summer).</p>

<p>Study copies of the biblical text will be provided in class. Those who would like to go further on their own during the week are encouraged to pick up a copy of <em>Galatians: A 12-Week Study</em> by Geoff Ziegler (Crossway, 2015) in the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series, which is <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?event=AFF&amp;p=1178855&amp;item_no=543029">available from christianbook.com for about $8</a>.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://duncanjohnson.ca/images/2014/12/whitefield.jpg"></p>
<p>On 16 December 1714 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates">O.S.</a>), George Whitefield was born at the Bell Inn, Southgate Street, Gloucester. This past week, his birthday was commemorated on Twitter with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Whitefield300">#Whitefield300</a> at the suggestion of <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasSKidd/status/539919555921862656">Whitefield biographer Thomas Kidd</a>.</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> to archive the tweet stream. At first, I was just appending the tweets to an Evernote file. When I set that up, I didn’t know that IFTTT is limited to only 30 updates to Evernote per hour, which obviously didn’t work out too well once the volume picked up on the morning of December 16. Once I realized what was going on, I set up a Google Sheet to collect the tweet stream, and this seems to have been much more reliable.</p>
<p>Below is my attempt to compile some of the resources available on Whitefield, including links to my Google Sheet and Evernote file. If I have missed anything of significance, please drop me a line (email <a href="mailto:djohnson@foundationbaptistcollege.ca">duncan-at-duncanjohnson-dot-ca</a> or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/dtjohnso">@dtjohnso</a>) and I’ll be glad to update the list.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://duncanjohnson.ca/images/2014/12/tn_4850.png"></p>
<p>Bebbington, David W. <em>Baptists through the Centuries: A History of a Global People.</em> Waco, TX: Baylor University Press, 2010.</p>
<p>This book was runner-up in my textbook adoption process for my Baptist history course. I have not yet read this book in full, but I have found portions of this book to be helpful as I prepared lectures. I chose not to select this book as required course reading for two reasons:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Published as it is by Baylor University Press, it costs slightly more than Leonard.</li>
<li>Bebbington follows a <em>synthetic</em> rather than <em>chronological</em> approach to the details of Baptist history. He describes the synthetic approach in the paragraph quoted below.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is primarily a work of synthesis that attempts to put the pieces of the puzzle into an intelligible framework. Its approach, therefore, is topical. In accordance with the maxim that it is better to study problems rather than periods, each chapter addresses an issue in Baptist history. … A second feature of the book is its effort to set the problems at hand in a wider context than Baptist history. Baptists did not exist alone, and so the analysis gives space to the broader influences—intellectual, social, and political—that played on religious developments. … The third aspect worth mentioning is the principle of organization. Countries are not kept apart, for that misrepresents the reality of the past. For all the contrasts between different nations, Baptists traveled between them, read each other’s writings, and corresponded across oceans. What happened in one part of the world was often duplicated elsewhere.” (pp. 4–5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach is self-evident when you look at the chapter titles, listed below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Roots in the Reformation</li>
<li>Anabaptists and Baptists</li>
<li>Particular and General Baptists in the Seventeenth Century</li>
<li>Baptists and Revival in the Eighteenth Century</li>
<li>Divisions among Baptists in the Nineteenth Century</li>
<li>Theological Polarization among Baptists</li>
<li>Baptists and the Social Gospel</li>
<li>Gospel and Race among Baptists</li>
<li>Women in Baptist Life</li>
<li>Church, Ministry, and Sacraments among Baptists</li>
<li>Baptists and Religious Liberty</li>
<li>Baptists and Foreign Mission</li>
<li>The Global Spread of the Baptists</li>
<li>Baptist Identity</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>There is certainly plenty of merit for the use of a synthetic approach to historical study, and I’ve benefited immensely from reading other works that follow this approach (in fact, <em>Turning Points</em> by Noll is highly synchronic in some chapters). However, I don’t think a synthetic approach would work well for beginning students who had no general chronological framework into which to plug the disparate concepts a synthetic study would bring to the surface. However, for readers with a general familiarity with the Baptist story, Bebbington’s work may prove a refreshing approach. The synthetic approach is somewhat of a current trend in historiography, but I was encouraged to find that others share my relative antipathy towards it as a practice. For instance, John Aloisi (Assistant Professor of Historical Theology at Detroit Baptist Theological Seminary), gave the following recommendation for this book on <a href="http://dbts.edu/blog/learning-about-the-past-exploring-baptist-history/">his blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is a very interesting read…. Although described by the publisher as “a chronological survey” (back cover), Bebbington’s work is largely arranged in a topical format that can be be helpful though it also has the potential to be a bit disorienting at times. For example, I found it rather odd to read about William Carey almost 100 pages after Walter Rauschenbusch when Carey was born exactly 100 years before Rauschenbusch. Similarly, the book includes a chapter titled “Women in Baptist Life” (ch. 10). I wondered, why not just discuss key Baptist women at appropriate points in the historical narrative (e.g., in the first nine chapters)? I don’t see a compelling reason for making that topic a distinct chapter. A similar observation could be made about the chapter on religious liberty (ch. 12). On the other hand, if one wants to read an insightful chapter on these topics or on things like Baptists and the social gospel (ch. 8) or Baptists and race relations (ch. 9), Bebbington is a very good place to turn. Overall, Bebbington’s work is definitely helpful and well worth reading, but the potential reader should realize that Bebbington doesn’t tell the story of Baptist history in anything like a chronological narrative. So I’m recommending it with the caveat that if you like to read history in a generally chronological format, Bebbington may drive you crazy. But if you want to read about some key topics in Baptist history, this is a helpful book by a first rate historian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So anyway, if you’re glazed over with all this rambling about historiography, let me just bring this back to a point of usefulness by sharing Bebbington’s own statements summing up the overall point of the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This book attempts to address the question of who Baptists have been over the four centuries of their existence. It tries to take account of ways in which they adapted to the societies in which they lived as well as their central practices. … [I]t must not be assumed that Baptists possessed a single, consistent identity. There were, after all, many types of Baptists. … The variety of Christian bodies called ‘Baptist’ has to be taken into account. So does the consideration that there was great deal of change over time. The circumstances of the early seventeenth century, when Baptists first arose, were very different from those of the early twenty-first century. It was a hallmark of the denomination to be strongly attached to the Bible, but ways of understanding the place of scripture in ordering church life altered over the centuries. Again there was much variation over space.” (p. 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The coverage of this book extends not just over England in the period from 1609 to the present but also over the world at large. … There is, therefore, a need for Baptist history to have an international dimension. Because research on many countries (including some of the nations just mentioned) is at a very preliminary stage, there are all too many gaps in the coverage of the present volume. The aim here is not to deal with every country where Baptists have existed, but to discuss broad trends with representative instances.” (pp. 3-4)</p>
