> But among all our joys, there was no one that more filled our hearts, than the blessed continuance of the preaching of God’s sacred Word among us; which is that inestimable treasure, which excelleth all the riches of the earth; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself, not only to the time spent in this transitory world, but directeth and disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven.[^1]

Readers of the English Bible have had the privilege of "the blessed continuance of the preaching of God’s sacred Word" now for centuries, a blessing that is dependent upon popular access to reliable English translations. At the time that the King James translators wrote these words, there were a handful of English translations available to the relatively small proportion of the world's population that spoke English. 

Today, those circumstances have changed. Thanks to the growth of the British Empire in the Victorian era and today's trend toward globalization, English now serves as the trade language for the world. This burgeoning market of English readers has created a demand for updated translations, and today there is such a proliferation of English Bibles on the market that publishers now compete for readership with slick marketing campaigns.

This lecture will attempt to explain how we arrived at this point from such humble beginnings. <!-- Include some learning objectives and more survey thoughts here about the overall outline of the article -->

The history of the English Bible divides into three eras:

1. The Medieval period (ca. 700--1500)
2. The English Reformation to the 19th century (ca. 1500--1900)
3. The 20th and 21st centuries (1901--2013)

## 1. The Medieval period (ca. 700--1500)

### 1.1. Early Christian heritage of the British Isles

The story of the English Christianity begins under the Roman empire. Christian influence can be found in England as early as the first and second centuries[^2], although it is unknown how Christianity arrived. These early Christians were wiped out when the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes pushed the Romans out of England during the early 5th century. Christianity carried on in the regions of Ireland and Scotland during this time under the leadership of men such as Patrick (5th century) in Ireland and Columba (6th century) in Scotland.

Eventually, Christianity reappeared in England in two competing streams. Missionaries from Scotland were first to arrive, establishing Celtic Christianity. Meanwhile, Roman Christianity was reestablished by Augustine of Canterbury (601--604), who was commissioned by Pope Gregory I (590--604). 

Celtic Christianity established itself first in Lindisfarne (known as "the Holy Island"), under the leadership of Aidan ca. A.D. 635.

## 2. The English Reformation to the 19th century (ca. 1500--1900)



### 2.1. William Tyndale

<!-- Brent Cook, lectures 5 p 7:

2. William Tyndale (c. 1494-1536)
He came from an obscure childhood. The one note we have from his youth is that while young he had read that King Alfred had produced a translation of the Bible. He went to Oxford, unlike the others. He was disturbed that he was not encouraged to read the Scriptures. He complained that they were not allowed to look at the Scriptures until after 8 or 9 years of indoctrination in doctrines which prevented understanding of the Bible. In 1516, he came to Cambridge. He probably joined the meetings at the White Horse Inn. He later became a private tutor for Sir John Walsh of Gloucestershire. He seems to have convinced Sir John that a good translation of the Bible was necessary. He went outdoors to preach in the open air, and discovered that the Catholics created a rumor about him and attempted to ruin him. Distressed, he returned to Cambridge where he met an old scholar named William Latimer (no relation to Hugh). Latimer said to him: “Do you not know that the Pope is very anti-Christ, whom the Scriptures speaketh of ? But beware of what you say, for if you say so publicly you will lose your life.” Tyndale never overcame this. He was convinced that what England needed was a new translation of the Scripture. He found a man named Humphrey Monmouth who was interested in a translation of the Scripture and supported him. However, Monmouth advised him that England was not the best place to produce a translation. In 1524, Tyndale left all his goods with Monmouth and set sail for Hamburg. He did not know it, but he would never return. He is hard to track down at this point, because he is forever on the run. He printed Bibles in Cologne, but then quickly fled to Worms where he produced his first edition of the New Testament. He found German merchants who were all too glad to smuggle his Bibles into England. Eventually he wound up in Antwerp on the coast where it was easier to smuggle the Bibles back to England. In 1526 Bishop Tunstall ordered that all Tyndale Bibles were to be burned. It was too little too late. He wrote many other works, commentaries, The Obedience of a Christian Man, The Practice of the Prelates, and a great Dialogue with Thomas More. In all, he produced three editions of the New Testament until 1535. He then fell victim to a plot to lure him out of hiding. He was imprisoned in the Low Countries and ignored. Here he died on October 6, 1536. He was strangled and then his body burned at the stake. His last words, as they come down to us, were “Lord, Open the King of England’s eyes.” Ironically, his third edition was printed on the King’s press in England. Approximately 4/5 of this translation made it into the KJV.

### 2.2. The King James Bible

#### 2.2.1. Publication history

By current standards, seventeenth-century book printing appears informal and unstandardized, and the early production history of the KJV includes a variety of well-known printer's errors. These errors ranged in severity from comical typos (such as the "Printer's Bible" and "Vinegar Bible") to serious omissions (such as the "Wicked Bible"). 



## 3. The 20th and 21st centuries (1901--2011)

### 3.1. The New International Version
