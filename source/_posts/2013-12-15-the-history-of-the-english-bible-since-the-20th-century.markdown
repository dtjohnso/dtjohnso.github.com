*This post is intended as a follow-up to [my prior post][english-bible-1] on the history of the English Bible.*

Around the turn of the 19th century, a consensus began to develop that the archaic language of the KJV needed updating. This produced a number of different attempts to either 1) revise the KJV itself, or 2) produce a new translation using more contemporary English. Some of the more prominent attempts under each of these categories are listed below:

- Proposed revisions of the KJV
	1. British Revised Version (RV; 1881--1885)
	2. American Standard Version (ASV; 1901)
	3. Revised Standard Version (RSV; 1952)
	4. New King James Version (NKJV; 1982)
- Fresh translations
	1. Jerusalem Bible (1966)
	2. New American Bible and New English Bible (1970)
	3. New American Standard Bible (1971)
	4. Good News Bible (Today's English Version; 1976)
	5. New International Version (1978; minor update 1984)
	6. New Jerusalem Bible (1985)
	7. New Revised Standard Version (1990)
	8. Update to the NASB (1995)
	9. English Standard Version (2001)
	10. Today's New International Version (2005)
	11. NET Bible (2005)
	12. New International Version (2011 update)

## Revisions of the KJV

### Revised Version and American Standard Version (1881--1885, 1901)

### Revised Standard Version (1952)

### New King James Version (1982)

## Fresh translations (mostly)

### New American Standard Bible (1971; 1995)

<!-- Possibly put this after NIV, if it makes more sense logically -->

### The New International Version (1956--2011)

At this point, we will refer to a handout titled "Controversies relating to the NIV: Summary" which I wrote on Sept 7, 2009.

### Other modern translations

For some brief background on the ESV and HCSB, see William Combs' article in the bibliography, particularly pp. 11--15 and 21--22.
