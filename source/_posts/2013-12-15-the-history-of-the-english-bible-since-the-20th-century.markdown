*This post is intended as a follow-up to [my prior post][english-bible-1] on the history of the English Bible.*

Around the turn of the 19th century, a consensus began to develop that the archaic language of the KJV needed updating. At first, most efforts were focused on revising the existing English translations (usually focusing on the translations in the Tyndale/KJV tradition). Despite these efforts, however, a growing market developed for fresh translations from the original text. 


<!-- Reorganize listing below, or drop it entirely. -->

- Revisions in the Tyndale/KJV tradition
	1. British Revised Version (RV; 1881--1885)

	7. New Revised Standard Version (1990)

For some brief background on the ESV and HCSB, see William Combs' article in the bibliography, particularly pp. 11--15 and 21--22.


## Additional Resources

### Online media

The material in this lecture is designed to be supplemented by an [interactive timeline project](/English-Bible/) which I've worked on as a hobby since mid-2011. Many of the events described here will show up in there, with links to additional reading on Wikipedia.
