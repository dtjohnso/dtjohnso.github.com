In a [previous post][job-search-again], I mentioned that I was transitioning out of my position at [Meadowlands][mbc].

Since then, I have accepted a full-time position at [Foundation Baptist College][fbc] as an administrator and member of the faculty. 

My last day at Meadowlands will be September 27, and I will begin working at Foundation on September 30.
