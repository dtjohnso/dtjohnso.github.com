<!-- review contents -->

Conceived as a replacement for Robert Torbet's well-known text, *A History of the Baptists*, this book attempts to survey the worldwide history of Baptists from their origins in seventeeth-century England. 

> "The thesis of this book is relatively simple. It suggests that amid certain distinctives, Baptist identity is configured in a variety of ways by groups, subgroups, and individuals who claim the Baptist name. This identity extends across a theological spectrum from Arminian to Calvinist, from conservative to liberal, from open to closed communionist, and from denominationalist to independent." (xi)

Predictably, the book reflects the denominational affiliation of its publisher, Judson Press. As the [publishing arm of the American Baptist Churches USA][about-judson], Judson Press represents a particular constituency of Baptists. The book emphasizes this strain of Baptist identity, tracing the development of the ABCUSA out of the Northern Baptist Convention in some detail in chapter 16.

Unfortunately, the book omits or downplays some important events in Southern Baptist history. For instance, the extensive controversy over the modernism of Crawford H. Toy receives no treatment. Toy, though he was professor at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary from 1869--1879, is only mentioned as a missionary appointee to Japan who "never went because the [Foreign Mission Board] delayed all appointments in anticipation of the Civil War and related economic difficulties" (353). His professorship at Southern appears only as a parenthesis, and there is no mention of his broken engagement to missionary Lottie Moon. As [another reviewer has noted][duesing], the Conservative Resurgence in the SBC also receives scant coverage, appearing only in summary on pages 414--415.
