By necessity, the study of history requires the perusal of historic texts. By devoting attention to primary sources, the student learns from the perspective of eyewitnesses and participants. Sometimes reading primary sources uncovers the student's own bias; at other times it presents the biases of the original actors in their own context. In studying any historical period or genre, beginning students oftentimes ignore important primary sources, not necessarily from lack of interest, but because those texts are scattered in various locations. A common remedy for this problem is a sourcebook, a published edition of key primary sources on a given topic. Joseph Early's *Readings in Baptist History* provides an up-to-date sourcebook of key Baptist texts in one affordable volume. 

This work fills a largely overlooked niche in the literature on Baptist history. In his preface, Early observes that although several books on Baptist history have appeared since H. Leon McBeth's *Baptist Heritage: Four Centuries of Baptist Witness* in 1987, no new sourcebook has been produced since the 1990 release of McBeth's companion volume, *A Sourcebook for Baptist Heritage.* In this work, Early adds newer documents while also including "seminal older documents" (v) to provide a comprehensive update. 

In selecting texts for inclusion, Early seeks "to provide as broad a scope and be as inclusive as possible" (vi). As a result, representative texts from a variety of Baptist traditions appear within the collection, including "British Baptists, Black Baptists, American Baptists, Southern Baptists, Russian Baptists, Landmark Baptists, and Fundamental Baptists" (vi). Of course, selecting key texts to include means that some texts must be excluded, and Early notes that his selections were limited by word count and the interests of his intended audience of "students of Baptist history" (vi).

The selections in the book are organized chronologically, beginning with texts from the exiled English General Baptists led by John Smyth and Thomas Helwys in 1609. The list below shows the breakdown of chapters by century, showing that the book exhibits a generally even distribution over the course of Baptist history. A complete chapter listing is included below this review for detailed analysis.

* 17th century, 7 chapters                  
* 18th century, 8 chapters                 
* 19th century, 12 chapters                 
* 20th century, 14 chapters
