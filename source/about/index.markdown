I am a professor at [Foundation Baptist College][FBC] and the Church Administrator at [Meadowlands Baptist Church][Meadowlands] in [Edmonton, AB][map]. In the college, I teach Bible exposition and church history courses, and in my day-to-day work at the church I do a lot of different things. I also have some computer science background from my undergrad education, so I've put together a number of online [projects][projects].

## Personal

My wife [Meg](http://www.joyfulmelody.ca/) teaches private violin lessons, when she isn't busy taking care of our daughter. Some of the things we like to do when we spend time together include reading, spending time with friends, and walking down to the neighborhood park with our little girl.

### Library Subject Guides

I published these research guides during my time as a research assistant at the [Bob Jones University Mack Library][mack].
