I am a professor at [Foundation Baptist College][FBC] in [Edmonton, AB][map]. I [teach Bible exposition and church history courses][teaching]. I also have some computer science background from my undergrad education, so I've put together a number of online [projects][projects].

My wife [Meg](http://www.joyfulmelody.ca/) teaches private violin lessons, when she isn't busy taking care of our daughter. Some of the things we like to do together include reading, spending time with friends, and walking down to the neighborhood park with our little girl.
