I am a professor at [Foundation Baptist College][FBC] in Edmonton, AB. I [teach Bible exposition and church history courses][teaching]. I also have some computer science background from my undergrad education, so I've put together a number of online [projects][projects].

My wife [Meg](http://www.joyfulmelody.ca/) teaches private violin lessons. We like to read, spend time with friends, and take walks in the beautiful Edmonton river valley.
