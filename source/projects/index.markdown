## Active Projects

* [Timeline of Old Testament History](/OT-Timeline/). This timeline is based on my work with the Isaiah timeline, but expands it to include the history of Old Testament Israel. Because of the massive scope of Old Testament history, I anticipate that this project will be "in progress" for some time.
* [A Timeline of the English Bible](/English-Bible/). A timeline summarizing some of the relevant historical details in the history of the English Bible.
* [Baptist History Timeline](/Baptist-History/). This timeline, produced by my students, gives important events for the history of the Baptist denomination. There is still work to be done on this timeline, some of which I've noted [here](/blog/2013/12/06/student-work-showcase-baptist-history-timeline/).
* Bible study worksheets. I help to coordinate the adult education program at [Meadowlands Baptist Church][meadowlands]. This involves writing weekly study worksheets for the passages studied in Sunday morning classes. I have written study sheets for several New Testament books. These worksheets are available for download in ZIP archives containing versions in Word and PDF format.

## Past Projects  

* [Isaiah Visualizations](/Isaiah-Visualizations/). I've created a timeline of relevant historical events in the book of Isaiah as well as a map. These visualizations were created to supplement course materials for Ex204 Exposition of Isaiah at Foundation Baptist College, Edmonton, AB. The timeline portion of this project has been superseded by my Timeline of Old Testament History mentioned above.

### Library Subject Guides

I published these research guides during my time as a research assistant at the [Bob Jones University Mack Library][mack]. They contain valuable bibliographic and reference material for a variety of different topic areas. Other people are maintaining these now, but I did the vast majority of the work in producing these sites.

* [Biblical Commentaries (Technical)](http://libguides.bju.edu/commentaries). Lists technical, conservative commentaries for the books of the Bible.
* [Biblical Exegesis](http://libguides.bju.edu/bible). Software and online resources for studying the biblical text.
* [Biblical Greek](http://libguides.bju.edu/greek). Resources for Greek students at all levels.
* [Biblical Hebrew](http://libguides.bju.edu/hebrew). Resources for Hebrew (and Aramaic) students at all levels.
* [Children's Ministry Resources](http://libguides.bju.edu/extension). A comprehensive list of outreach ministry resources (such as Sunday School materials, flannelgraph, puppets, etc) available for checkout, including photos.
* [New Testament Greco-Roman Backgrounds](http://libguides.bju.edu/nt-backgrounds). Introductory material on the Greco-Roman world, including its history, society, culture, religion, and literature, in relation to the expansion of early Christianity and the New Testament documents.
* [Rare Bibles at Mack Library](http://libguides.bju.edu/rare-bibles) Lists rare Bibles stored in the Library's Jerusalem Chamber and Special Collections.
* [Seminary Project Labs - Greek & Hebrew fonts, Turabian, Zotero](http://libguides.bju.edu/seminary). Guides users through the installation and configuration of Greek and Hebrew fonts, the use of the BJU Seminary Turabian wizard, and Zotero.
