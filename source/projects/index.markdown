I use this page to organize links to various online projects that I've created in the past. This material is organized by category. In some cases, I link to both a newer and older version of the project.

## Software for Student Writing

* [Student Writing Helps](/Student-Writing-Helps/). A new website to host material I developed for the "Seminary Project Labs" site listed below. This version guides users through the installation and configuration of Greek and Hebrew fonts, the use of a Turabian template, and Zotero. 
* [Seminary Project Labs - Greek & Hebrew fonts, Turabian, Zotero](http://libguides.bju.edu/seminary). The original site that I created for this material. No longer includes open access to a Turabian template.

## Bible study

* Bible study worksheets. I help to coordinate the adult education program at [Meadowlands Baptist Church][meadowlands]. This involves writing weekly study worksheets for the passages studied in Sunday morning classes. I have written study sheets for several New Testament books. These worksheets are available for download in ZIP archives containing versions in Word and PDF format.
	- [Mark][mark]
	- [1 and 2 Peter][1-2-peter]
	- [Jude][jude]
	- [Ephesians][ephesians]
	- [1 Corinthians][1-corinthians]
	- [2 Corinthians][2-corinthians]
	- [1--3 John][1-3-john]
	- [Gospel of John][john]
* [Timeline of Old Testament History](/OT-Timeline/). This timeline is based on my work with the Isaiah timeline, but expands it to include the history of Old Testament Israel. Because of the massive scope of Old Testament history, I anticipate that this project will be "in progress" for some time.
* [Isaiah Visualizations](/Isaiah-Visualizations/). I've created a timeline of relevant historical events in the book of Isaiah as well as a map. These visualizations were created to supplement course materials for Ex204 Exposition of Isaiah at Foundation Baptist College, Edmonton, AB. The timeline portion of this project has been superseded by my "Timeline of Old Testament History" above.
* [Biblical Commentaries (Technical)](http://libguides.bju.edu/commentaries). A subject guide that lists technical, conservative commentaries for the books of the Bible.
* [Biblical Exegesis](http://libguides.bju.edu/bible). Software and online resources for studying the biblical text.
* [Biblical Greek](http://libguides.bju.edu/greek). Resources for Greek students at all levels.
* [Biblical Hebrew](http://libguides.bju.edu/hebrew). Resources for Hebrew (and Aramaic) students at all levels.

## Church History

* [A Timeline of the English Bible](/English-Bible/). A timeline summarizing some of the relevant historical details in the history of the English Bible.
* [Baptist History Timeline](/Baptist-History/). This timeline, produced by my students, gives important events for the history of the Baptist denomination. There is still work to be done on this timeline, some of which I've noted [here](/blog/2013/12/06/student-work-showcase-baptist-history-timeline/).

## Other Library Subject Guides

I published these research guides during my time as a research assistant at the [Bob Jones University Mack Library][mack]. They contain valuable bibliographic and reference material for a variety of different topic areas.

* [Children's Ministry Resources](http://libguides.bju.edu/extension). A comprehensive list of outreach ministry resources (such as Sunday School materials, flannelgraph, puppets, etc) available for checkout, including photos.
* [New Testament Greco-Roman Backgrounds](http://libguides.bju.edu/nt-backgrounds). Introductory material on the Greco-Roman world, including its history, society, culture, religion, and literature, in relation to the expansion of early Christianity and the New Testament documents.
* [Rare Bibles at Mack Library](http://libguides.bju.edu/rare-bibles) Lists rare Bibles stored in the Library's Jerusalem Chamber and Special Collections.
* [Sermon Index](http://libguides.bju.edu/sermons). Indexes sermons in books at the Mack Library by preacher and Scripture passage. Includes call numbers and page references.
