## Active Projects

* [Isaiah Visualizations](/Isaiah-Visualizations/). I've created a timeline of relevant historical events in the book of Isaiah as well as a map. These visualizations were created to supplement course materials for Ex204 Exposition of Isaiah at Foundation Baptist College, Edmonton, AB. 
* [A Timeline of the English Bible](/English-Bible/). A timeline summarizing some of the relevant historical details in the history of the English Bible.
* Adult Bible study group worksheets. During my time on staff at [Meadowlands Baptist Church][meadowlands], I was tasked with writing worksheets for use in conjunction with the passages studied during adult Bible study sessions on Sunday mornings. I wrote study sheets for several New Testament books. These worksheets are available for download in ZIP archives containing versions in Word and PDF format.

## Past Projects  
### Library Subject Guides

I published these research guides during my time as a research assistant at the [Bob Jones University Mack Library][mack]. They contain valuable bibliographic and reference material for a variety of different topic areas. Other people are maintaining these now, but I did the vast majority of the work in producing these sites.

* [Biblical Exegesis](http://libguides.bju.edu/bible). Software and online resources for studying the biblical text.

* [Biblical Hebrew](http://libguides.bju.edu/hebrew). Resources for Hebrew (and Aramaic) students at all levels.
* [Children's Ministry Resources](http://libguides.bju.edu/extension). A comprehensive list of outreach ministry resources (such as Sunday School materials, flannelgraph, puppets, etc) available for checkout, including photos.
* [New Testament Greco-Roman Backgrounds](http://libguides.bju.edu/nt-backgrounds). Introductory material on the Greco-Roman world, including its history, society, culture, religion, and literature, in relation to the expansion of early Christianity and the New Testament documents.
