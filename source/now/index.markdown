<!-- TODO: Always update the YAML date when making changes! -->

I am currently preparing for Spring 2016 semester, which begins on January 25. I'll be out of the office for a couple weeks between now and then for holidays.

Once that semester begins, I'll be doing the following:

* teaching five classes at Foundation Baptist College (two of which are brand-new to me and will require most of my time in preparation, one of which I'm teaching in two different sections to two different audiences)
* writing lectures for the above-mentioned classes
* meeting with students and colleagues as required ([book a time that works for you](http://doodle.com/duncan.johnson))
* teaching a [Sunday School class at my church on the books of Galatians and then Romans](http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2015/12/18/a-study-in-galatians-and-romans/)
* spending evenings and weekends with my wife and kids and occasionally with close friends
* reading interesting books
* skating

If my activities or priorities change, then I'll update this page.
