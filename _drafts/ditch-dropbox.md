For years, I was a happy user of Dropbox. I even paid for it so I could store more stuff in there. Originally, the killer feature for me was that Dropbox would sync my files across all the devices I've owned. I've almost always had some combination of laptops and desktops (and eventually mobiles). This means that I need the ability to pick up where I left off on a project, regardless of what device I'm using.

How much did I pay for Dropbox? Well, I paid for it for six years and one month. This cost me $99 USD per year, and that last month cost me $9.99 USD (more on that in a second). When I first started paying in 2013, that bought me 100GB of space, which was great. Two years later, Dropbox upped the max limit to 1TB. For several of those years, I was living in Canada, so I was actually paying these fees with Canadian dollars, which meant that I was paying approximately $130 CAD each year when you factor in exchange rate and hidden Paypal conversion fees (yes, they have those). Just in US dollars, though, that's $600 over the course of my time as a paying customer.

As I write this, they've apparently again bumped that max limit up again to 2TB. But I don't care, and I've cancelled my paid account. Dropbox will no longer get any of my money.

Why did I cancel? Why do I not care about having 2TB of space? Two reasons:

1. I never came close to filling up my 1TB. In fact, the way my computer systems were set up, I never could. That extra terabyte that just got added wasn't even possible for me.
2. Dropbox has never tried to offer me any kind of data privacy. In fact, they profit from my consent to let them analyze my data. Not cool.

In the video below, Steve Dotto talks about why that's problematic, and introduces the alternative that I've moved to instead, sync.com:

At peak, I had about 150 GB of stuff stored in my Dropbox Plus account. When I switched to Sync, I took the time to clean up a bunch of junk that was in there, and was able to reduce my total synced footprint to about 100 GB. That's a 33% decrease in bloat right there.

But more importantly, we need to look at what I had to pay to store this stuff with Sync. At Sync.com, I bought their lowest price personal tier, which gives 500GB for $50 per year.

For me, the benefits are that I pay about half as much annually for basically the same service, and my files are (at least theoretically) encrypted.
