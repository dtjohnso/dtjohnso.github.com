For now, let me say just a couple things:

1) This is a notoriously difficult area of theology. Certain questions are difficult to answer because there is limited data.

2) One common theme in the stuff he sent is that allegedly the church just imported categories from Greek philosophy which are supposedly at odds with Old Testament texts.
	a) I am not convinced that's based on a respectful reading of the Old and New Testaments. 
	b) Similarities with "Greek thought" are not an automatic flag for error. If we go that direction, we ultimately have to modify our view of Scripture and see it as an errant text every time it draws from outside sources. 
	c) I also question whether we should describe "Greek thought" as monolithic on this topic. However, I don't have the time or interest to pursue that.
