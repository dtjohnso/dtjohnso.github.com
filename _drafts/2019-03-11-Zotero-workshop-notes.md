Today I had the opportunity to give a workshop demonstrating the use of Zotero for academic writing. I've created a number of support materials for Zotero over the years, as well as gathered other helpful resources from around the web.

## Stuff I've made

Most of the material I've written in this area is organized onto my ambitiously named site ["Student Writing Helps"](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/). Sometimes you spend all your creative energy on building something, and when it comes to naming your thing, well, you get quality like that.

There are two main pages on the Student Writing Helps site that are relevant to what I discussed in this workshop today. Follow the links on these pages to find most of the things you'll need:

* [Turabian help page](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/turabian/)
* [Zotero page](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/zotero/)

## Useful stuff other people made

I've also collected some useful links here. Eventually I should probably add these to the right places on the "Student Writing Helps" site, but for now it's easier to just put it all in one place.

* The [Turabian website](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/turabian.html) includes some handy resources for students writing in Turabian style. Plus it describes the changes to the latest edition.
* [Andy Naselli's blog on organizing your Zotero collections](http://andynaselli.com/personal-theological-library/) is a must read. I wish I had taken his advice years ago and organized my Zotero collections into some sort of logical hierarchy of topics. Now I have an inchoate mess and just have to search it all the time, which means I may miss stuff if I use the wrong search terms. Of course, I'm to blame here, not the software.
* [Zotero announces Google Docs support](https://www.zotero.org/blog/google-docs-integration/) in this blog post, and it's pretty cool. I probably wouldn't write a major academic capstone project in a Google Doc... but you have to admit that this is just cool.
