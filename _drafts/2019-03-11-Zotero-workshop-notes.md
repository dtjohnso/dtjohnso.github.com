This post contains my notes for a workshop demonstrating the use of Microsoft Word and Zotero for academic writing.

## Reference pages

Most of the material I'll be presenting today is available on my ambitiously named site ["Student Writing Helps"](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/) (sometimes you spend all your creative energy on building something, and when it comes to naming your thing, well, you get quality like that).

These pages from that site have links to everything you'll need for today:

* [Turabian page](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/turabian/)
* [Zotero page](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/zotero/)

## Intro

- About me: BJU library, taught at FBC in Edmonton, now an editor at PAFC
- And also about me: my undergrad degree included a minor concentration in the Department of Computer Science at BJU
- My approach to teaching software skills:
	+ Show, then tell
	+ Put the big rocks (abstract concepts) in the jar first, then the little rocks (details of implementation).
	+ You don't need to remember all the little rocks. Stay on track with the end goal, then Google the details if you forget.
	+ I will provide support links for self-study and reference later on.
	+ If you really get stuck, Joel can get you my email address. It would be my pleasure to hear from you.

## Agenda for Today:

**Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this class, you should be able to: 

1. Properly structure a formal research paper in Microsoft Word (or an open-source alternative);
2. Collect, organize, and accurately cite research sources using Zotero.

And perhaps, if we get there, I might be able to share a few tidbits about good principles of computational thinking. For me, that means a healthy dose of the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) of computing, which either means something to you now or it doesn't. 
<!-- https://opensource.com/business/15/2/how-linux-philosophy-affects-you -->
<!-- TODO: Smooth out the above paragraph -->
Either way, we have a lot to cover. Ready to dive in?

## Using Turabian templates in Word

1. Read the manual! (5 min)
	- **Part 1** describes the research process
	- **Part 2** describes technicalities of citations
	- **Part 3** describes general issues of writing style
	- **Appendix** describes page layout issues, with examples
	- **Using a chapter:** chapter outline; section numbers
2. Turabian Template demo (30-35 min)
	- Download from **[Writing Helps site](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/)** (5 mins) 
	- Create Cover Page and First Page (5 mins)
	- **Styles are your friend! (10-15 mins)**
		+   bodytext, t, text
		+   quote, q
		+   Headings (including invisible headers)
		+   Footnotes
		+   bibliography, bib
	- Show **auto TOC** (5 mins)
	- Show **Turabian Lorem Ipsum (5 mins)**

## Zotero (90 min)

<!-- TODO: Rewrite this intro? -->
<!-- TODO: Incorporate new ideas from the teaching Turabian handout from UChicago? -->

Think of the last big paper you wrote. How many books and articles did you cite? How did you manage all of those references and articles?

By taking an hour or so to learn how to use citation management software now, you will **improve the efficiency of your research** and **save hundreds of hours** with the papers you'll write in the future.

### Quick Demo (5 min)

Rather than giving a lengthy explanation about how citation managers work, let's run through a quick demonstration. Consider this to be a preview. 

### Installing Zotero (20 min)

<!-- TODO: Figure out how to cover this part -->
<!-- TODO: Make sure it's currently accurate -->

-   Four essential components: 
	1.   Zotero Standalone
	2.   Word processor plugin (nowadays usually installs with Zotero, but if not, you can download it on the plugins page)
	3.   Browser connector (available for Chrome, Firefox, Opera)
	4.   Turabian citation style settings 
-   Zotero addon
    -   create an account at zotero.org
    -   set username and password in plugin
-   Word plugin and Turabian style

### Find & save sources on catalog search pages (20 min)

-   **Library catalog (single item; multiple from list)**
    -   **library.foundationbaptistcollege.com**
    -   **library.ualberta.ca**
    -   WorldCat
-   **Amazon.com**
-   Google Books
-   Regular web page
-   Manual entry

### Organize your notes (20 min)

-   Fix errors
-   **Collections & subcollections**
-   **Tags**
-   **Search & saved searches**
-   Notes

### Cite your sources (use Lorem Ipsum) (20 min)

-   Insert citations into the text.
-   Create a bibliography.
-   Move three citations.
-   Refresh bibliography.
-   Change style and refresh again.
-   Remove Zotero codes and save document.
