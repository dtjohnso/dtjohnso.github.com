description: Notes for a workshop on using template files for Turabian style research papers in Microsoft Word, and how to organize and cite research sources using Zotero.
---

This post contains my notes for a workshop demonstrating the use of Microsoft Word and Zotero for academic writing.

## Quick Reference

The material I'll be presenting today is available via links on my ambitiously named site ["Student Writing Helps"](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/) (sometimes you spend all your creative energy on building something, and when it comes to naming your thing, well, you get quality like that).

The main pages with links to everything you'll need for today:

* [Turabian page](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/turabian/)
* [Zotero page](http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/zotero/)

What follows below here is my own notes for the presentation. 

## Introduction

**Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this class, you should be able to: 

1. Properly structure a formal research paper in Microsoft Word (or an open-source alternative);
2. Collect, organize, and accurately cite research sources using Zotero.

<!-- And perhaps, if we get there, I might be able to share a few tidbits about good principles of computational thinking. For me, that means a healthy dose of the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy).  -->
<!-- https://opensource.com/business/15/2/how-linux-philosophy-affects-you -->
<!-- TODO: Smooth out the above paragraph -->


**My background:**

+ Developed these workshops while a grad assistant at the BJU library
+ Taught at FBC in Edmonton
+ Now an editor at PAFC
+ Also my undergrad degree included a minor concentration in the Department of Computer Science at BJU, so I have some theoretical background that helps with this kind of thing

**My approach to teaching software skills:**

We are discussing the skilled use of a tool, not the intricate nuances of a theological distinction. This is unlike most seminary training, which often involves summarizing a vast canon of received wisdom on a topic. You learn canonical wisdom by (to an extent) passive absorption. You learn skills by observing, experimenting, and making mistakes.

The main thing you need to take away from this presentation is an understanding of the abstract concepts involved in the process, not the details of implementation. Don't get side-tracked trying to write down every single click I make or every step in the process.

In fact, you don't need to remember all the little details or every little step in the process. If you find that you have forgotten a step later when you're trying to do this yourself, you can always consult support materials online. To that end, I am providing support links for self-study and reference in my notes.

If you really get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help. It would be my pleasure to hear from you.

## Using Turabian template files in Word 

1. Read the manual! (5 min)
	- Part 1 describes the research process
	- Part 2 describes technicalities of citations
	- Part 3 describes general issues of writing style
	- Appendix describes page layout issues, with examples
	- Using a chapter: chapter outline; section numbers
2. Turabian Template demo (30-35 min)
	- Download templates from Writing Helps site
	- Create Cover Page and First Page 
	- Styles are your friend! Important styles in the template include: 
		+   bodytext, t, text
		+   quote, q
		+   Headings (including invisible headers)
		+   Footnotes
		+   bibliography, bib
	- Show automatic Table of Contents
	- Show Turabian Lorem Ipsum file

## Zotero

Think of the last big paper you wrote. How many books and articles did you cite? How did you manage all of those references and articles?

By taking an hour or so to learn how to use citation management software now, you will improve the efficiency of your research and save hundreds of hours with the papers you'll write in the future.

### Quick Demo

Rather than giving a lengthy explanation about how citation managers work, let's run through a quick demonstration. Consider this to be a preview. 

### Installing Zotero 

Zotero includes four essential components, three of which you have to install:

1. Zotero
2. Zotero browser connector (available for Chrome, Firefox, Opera)
3. Word processor plugin (usually installs automatically with Zotero Standalone)
4. If you need to use Turabian style, you have to add it to your Zotero Style Manager. Instructions on adding a citation styles are available [here](https://www.zotero.org/support/styles), and you can find Turabian in the Zotero Style Repository.

I won't go through the process of installing Zotero from scratch. The install process is pretty easy. 

For a lot of users, Zotero Sync provides a reliable way to both back up your research, and to access it on multiple devices. To set that up, you have to create an account on zotero.org. This is optional though, and I won't demonstrate setting it up because it takes a long time for my personal library to sync to a new device for the first time.

### Find & save sources

-   Library catalog (single items; multiple from list)
    -   [Bob Jones University Mack Library](http://libraryaccount.bju.edu/search~S7?/dJustification+%28Christian+theology%29/djustification+christian+theology/1%2C9%2C94%2CB/exact&FF=djustification+christian+theology&1%2C72%2C/indexsort=-)

-   [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=soteriology)
-   [Google Books](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=downgrade+controversy)
-   A [blog post](https://www.challies.com/)
-   Regular web page
-   Manually enter a random book off my desk

### Organize your notes

-   Fix errors
-   Collections & subcollections
-   Tags
-   Search & saved searches
-   Notes

### Cite your sources (use Lorem Ipsum file)

-   Insert citations into the text.
-   Create a bibliography.
-   Move three citations.
-   Refresh bibliography.
-   Change style and refresh again.
-   Remove Zotero codes and save document.
