title: What about OneDrive?

I think Onedrive is great if you need to have an Office 365 license anyway. Lots of people do, I don't currently b/c a bunch of things unique to my setup.

I will have to research this, but my impression is that OneDrive also doesn't give you data privacy like Sync does, so if that's important than you have a choice to make.

New feature seems a response to that?

How do they compare?

I think it's basically analogous, except you get Office with it. There are lots of tedious feature-by-feature comparisons out there. Those are a drag to read because at the end of the day they're all doing basically the same thing. The Office 365 + Onedrive pairing is the killer feature that they offer, and neither Dropbox or Google Drive can come close to that.

Dustin:
OneDrive offers a similar feature to SmartSync: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Save-disk-space-with-OneDrive-Files-On-Demand-for-Mac-529f6d53-e572-4922-a585-e7a318c135f0
...but you have to run Mojave ðŸ˜ž My computer can technically run Mojave, but it would slow it down too much, so I'm still running Sierra.

When Dropbox first rolled out smart sync, it was actually controversial in the Linux world because in order to make it work they had to have kernel access. (It gets more technical from that point on, and quickly outside my paygrade...)
Anyway, I suspect that's part of the root of your issue there.
