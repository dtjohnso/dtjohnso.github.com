I was recently corresponding with a friend who is a pastor. He had an interesting question. Should churches video stream a baptism during the COVID-19 pandemic, when we are required to keep physical distance from one another?

For whatever reason, I've seen online discussions about whether to livestream the communion and church services in general. As Christians, it is right for us to look to the Bible to see whether and how we should adapt our lives to face new situations. Here's [one helpful example](http://wyattgraham.com/why-you-should-have-virtual-worship-services-because-of-our-exceptional-circumstances/) of this. However, I haven't seen much talk specifically about baptisms. 

<!-- Assumptions -->

(I'm assuming that an ordained elder is physically immersing the catechumen in front of a camera.)

<!-- Need to make some sort of caveat about PPE -->

<!-- Meaning with brief biblical backup -->

At risk of pedantry, let's clarify a few definitions. As a Protestant Christian, baptism<!-- ... -->

<!-- Application -->

It's still a public proclamation of faith (arguably more public than traditional baptisms). It still symbolizes union with Christ. It still doesn't communicate grace.

If we get too procedural about this, then we have to invalidate a lot of past baptisms, including historic ones.

<!-- Should we wait until the church can once again gather? -->

I do think there is one practical reason to not wait, aside from the normal line. (The normal line being that delays never occurred in the NT, and so it makes no sense now.)

The new reason not to wait is that the COVID crisis itself presents a new exigency. If this person were to die prior to a delayed baptism, we'd have done them a pastoral disservice if they were ready and willing to pursue baptism while they were alive.

I can't remember exactly where, but I think I remember reading about various Reformers using that line of reasoning to justify somewhat private in-home baptisms during times of plague. Obviously, some of them saw more in baptism than I do. But still the logic there remains intact.

<!-- Does this undermine the importance of the gathered church? -->

I think that most people who truly comprise the church inherently agree that these kinds of provisional measures are not sustainable. But they may need help to understand why they feel that way.
