description: Slides for a presentation describing the origins of the King James Only movement.
---

Last Saturday I presented a lecture on the history of the King James Only movement within Fundamentalism. The [slides are now available][presentation].

The lecture was based on an article by Jeff Straub titled "Fundamentalism and the King James Version: How a Venerable English Translation Became a Litmus Test for Orthodoxy." There is more research that I'd like to do in this area at a future date, but for now, this is as far as I've gone with the history of the movement.
