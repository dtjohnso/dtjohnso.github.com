For several of my classes, I've taken to using Dropbox's "File Request" feature for having students submit writing assignments. It's really easy for students to use:

1. Open the File Request link for your project
2. Drag and drop the file
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. I get the file instantly

**Note:** If you don't get an email confirmation from Dropbox, you didn't do it correctly (usually that means you forgot to click "Submit"). In that case, just try again.

Here's a quick (7 seconds) video demo:
