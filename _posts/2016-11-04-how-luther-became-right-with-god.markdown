I had the opportunity to give a lecture entitled, "How Luther Became Right with God (and You Can Too!)" at [Meadowlands Baptist Church](http://www.meadowlandsbaptist.com/) this past Sunday (30 October 2016). In the lecture, I describe some of the major events in Luther's life from the *Ninety-five Theses* to the Diet of Worms in 1521, and then provide some reflections on the significance of Luther's views on justification and sanctification. Much of the content in this video is adapted from material I prepared for the [Reformation Conference I spoke at in Calgary](http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2016/10/08/reformation-conference-in-calgary/).

The video above includes my slides in the corner, but you can also download just the audio (if you prefer) from SermonAudio [here](https://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?SID=1030162124543).
