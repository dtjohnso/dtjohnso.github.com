I made this screencast video for a class I was teaching where my students were responsible to create a clause display showing the structure of Colossians 3:12-17. After the students completed the assignment, I created this video. which shows my attempt at a clause display of the passage to help them understand the marks I made on their papers. I thought I'd share it here as well for anyone who's interested in studying this Scripture passage.
