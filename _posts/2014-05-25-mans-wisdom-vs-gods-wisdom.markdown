description: An excellent sermon on 1 Cor. 1:18.

Every now and then, you hear somebody preach a sermon that really sticks in your memory. For me, this happened when I heard [this sermon][sermon] ([alternate mirror link][sermon-mirror]) by Brent Cook in chapel at Bob Jones University. The message takes <span>1 Cor. 1:18</span> as its foundational text:

> For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are
> perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
> (<span>1Â Corinthians 1:18</span> NKJ)

I replayed this sermon for my students in my class on evangelism a year later, and I've listened to this message many times since. It came to mind again today as I was studying 2 Cor. 2:12--3:18.
