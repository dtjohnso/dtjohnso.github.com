This website is my home for linking together all my various online interests. I have enjoyed teaching [Bible exposition, theology, and church history courses][teaching] at [Foundation Baptist College][FBC] in Edmonton, AB. I also have some computer science background from my undergrad education, so I've put together a number of online [projects][projects]. Every once in a while, I even write blog posts here about theology, exegesis, and tech---but not too often yet, so I probably don't actually have an audience yet besides you!

My wife [Meg](http://www.joyfulmelody.ca/) teaches private violin lessons. We like to read, spend time with friends, and take walks in the beautiful Edmonton river valley.
