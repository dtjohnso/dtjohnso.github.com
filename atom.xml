	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’d like to add a few comments on an interesting debate over at my Dad’s blog about the New Testament’s use of the term translated “church” (<em>ekklesia</em>).</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="http://oxgoad.ca/2013/10/22/ekklesia/">one post</a>, he argues that the biblical usage of the term “church” suggests that there is such a thing as the “universal church,” defined as “a universal body of believers that includes all believers from all ages in one spiritual union, the church.”</li>
<li>In a <a href="http://oxgoad.ca/2013/10/27/ekklesia-part-2/">followup</a>, he goes further, demonstrating from biblical texts that the word is also used for what we call the “visible church,” inclusive of the sum total of professing believers on earth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>Suggesting that the word “church” can mean anything other than a “local church” can get you into trouble with some Baptists, and so an interesting discussion broke out in the comments on both posts. In the comments, my Dad asks one question for his local-church-only interlocutors: <strong>“Why is the idea of local church only so important? Or, to put it another way, why is the idea of the universal church dangerous?”</strong></p>
<h2 id="ideas-and-consequences">Ideas and Consequences</h2>
<p>I’d like to suggest one reason why local-church-only advocates cannot concede the existence of the universal church. (Of course, doing so requires that they ignore the plain reading of texts such as Ephesians 1:22–23, but for the exegesis I refer you again to <a href="http://oxgoad.ca/2013/10/22/ekklesia/">the original post</a>.) <!-- more --> The idea that the term “church” can only refer to a local assembly is simply a necessary corollary of Landmarkist theology. Landmarkism depends on an uninterrupted succession of local assemblies to support the theory that the “true church” comprises the Baptist tradition throughout the ages. This (widely discredited) view of history is known as <a href="http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/th106-2013/lectures/lecture-1-theories-of-baptist-origins/">Baptist successionism</a>.</p>
<p>If a Landmarkist allows for a universal aspect to the church, he implies that genuine believers might be found outside of the supposed succession of local churches (the “Baptists”) but within the scope of Christendom (including medieval Catholics).</p>
<p>Because the Landmarkist is predisposed to avoid that conclusion, he must go to great lengths to justify a local-only view of the church. Seen in this light, the local-only view becomes nothing more than part of an artificial perimeter around the Landmarkist theory.</p>
<h2 id="historical-evidence">Historical Evidence</h2>
<p>If the explanation above is correct, we would expect to find the idea that the local-church-only idea in the writings of the early Landmarkists. Today, I ran across some evidence that confirms that early Landmarkists indeed believed that the Bible does not allow for a universal or invisible church.</p>
<figure>
<img src="http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/th106-2013/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/220px-JamesRobinsonGraves.jpg" title="J. R. Graves" alt="J. R. Graves" /><figcaption>J. R. Graves</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>J. R. Graves was not the first to hold Landmarkism, but he was certainly one its most vociferous early proponents. Through his influence, successionist historiography and Landmark ecclesiology became a significant force within American Baptist circles.</p>
<p>In Leon McBeth’s history of the Baptist movement, he notes that Graves believed the church to be “a single congregation, complete in itself, independent of all other bodies, civil or religious, … amenable only to Christ.”<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup> He thought that the “invisible church” was nothing more than “invisible nonsense.” In a more extended quote, Graves argues that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the only church that is revealed to us is a visible church, and the only church with which we have anything to do, or in connection with which we have any duties to perform, is a visible body…. Christ never set up but one kingdom; and if this is visible, he has no invisible kingdom or church, and such a thing has no real existence in heaven or earth. It is only an invention to bolster up erroneous theories of ecclesiology.<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>In evaluating Graves’ statements, this quote from Sidney Ahlstrom is telling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of Graves’s argument was a doctrine of the Kingdom which allowed a syllogism to do the work of historical research: the Kingdom has prevailed; the Kingdom must always have included true churches; Baptist churches are the only true churches; therefore, Baptist churches have always existed.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an historical theory, successionism is bankrupt because it is based on an absence of evidence. Likewise, the view that the New Testament only speaks of the local church requires us to ignore clear biblical evidence. It seems to me that the only reason to hold this view is to support the scaffold for the rest of Landmark theology.</p>

	<id>http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2013/11/03/hoehner-on-ephesians-4-4-6</id>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0801026148/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=0801026148&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=duncanjohns04-20"><img src="http://duncanjohnson.ca/images/2013/11/hoehner.jpg" alt="Hoehner on Ephesians" /></a></p>
<p>Today in my Adult Bible study class at <a href="http://www.meadowlandsbaptist.ca/">Meadowlands Baptist Church</a> we discussed these verses in Ephesians 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>NKJ</sup> <strong>Ephesians 4:4-6</strong> There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling; <sup>5</sup> one Lord, one faith, one baptism; <sup>6</sup> one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0801026148/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=330641&amp;creativeASIN=0801026148&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=duncanjohns04-20">Hoehner</a> to be helpful in unpacking Paul’s meaning in these verses, so I decided to share his comments on these verses.</p>
<!-- more -->

<blockquote>
<p><strong>4:4.</strong> The sevenfold use of “one” (εἷς, μία, ἕν) emphasizes unity.</p>
<p>First, there is one body (ἓν σῶμα), which refers to the universal church already discussed (1:23; 2:16; 3:5–6). … it is not that Gentiles become Jews, as in the OT, nor Jews become Gentiles, but that unbelieving Jews and Gentiles become one body of believers when they place their faith in the work of Christ at Calvary. They are no longer two entities but one.</p>
<p>Second, there is the one Spirit (ἓν πνεῦμα) referring to the Holy Spirit. …</p>
<p>Third, there is one hope.With this clause Paul breaks from the pattern of verses 4a and 5–6 and refers back to the call mentioned in verse 1. He does this in order to give a conceptual framework on which the rest of the exhortation is based. … The noun ἐλπίς, “hope,” was discussed in 1:18 and was defined as eager expectation of the outworking of God’s plan. The hope presented in Ephesians is the reality that all things will be headed up in Christ (1:9) and though the believers are presently seated with Christ, in the future they will be displayed in heaven as trophies of his grace (2:7). Further, they have been brought near to God, united into one body in Christ and reconciled to God (2:11–3:13). Before this they were without hope and without God in the world (2:12). Hence, there is the element of objective hope which is laid up for the believers (cf. Col 1:5; Rom 8:24), and this serves as the basis of the subjective hope. Hope for believers is not the world’s “hope so” but the absolute certainty that God will deliver what he has promised.</p>
<p>In conclusion, then, the elements of unity are portrayed in the one body, the one Spirit, and the one hope of their calling. The third person of the Trinity is the unifier in this verse.</p>
<p><strong>4:5.</strong> Fourth, there is one Lord. In the previous verse the third person of the Trinity was discussed, Paul now considers the second person, Christ. The word κύριος logically refers to Christ since Paul has just discussed the Holy Spirit in verse 4 and will discuss the Father in the next verse. Christ is the “one Lord” who provided redemption (1:7), hope (1:12), and headship over the church (1:22–23).</p>
<p>Fifth, there is one faith. The “one faith” does not have reference to an objective faith, the body of truth believed by Christians … as some propose, but rather to the subjective faith which is exercised by all Christians in Christ their Lord (cf. Col 2:7). … In the first chapter of this book, Paul mentions that the Ephesians had expressed their faith when they heard the message (1:13) and that their faith in the Lord Jesus was widely known (1:15). Thus, it is the one faith in the one Lord.</p>
<p>Sixth, there is one baptism. This phrase has caused some debate. There are two major views and a third should be considered. First, most commentators think it has reference to water baptism. … Second, some consider it to be a reference to the Spirit’s baptism. … A third option that needs to be considered is that it refers metaphorically to the believer’s baptism into Christ’s death, speaking of the believer’s union with Christ in his death and resurrection. … This same concept is seen in other NT passages (Rom 6:1–11; Gal. 3:27; Col 2:12). Furthermore, it fits well with the context, for the believer’s baptism into Christ signifies union with Christ (Rom 6:5) and it occurs at the time of conversion (Rom 6:2–4). This inward reality is all too often missed. It serves as the basis of the outward ritual. Hence, the “one baptism” most likely refers to the internal reality of having been baptized into (identified with) the “one Lord” by means of the “one faith” mentioned in this verse.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, there is unity in the one Lord in whom believers place their one faith expressed in one baptism signifying their identification in his death and resurrection. This verse revolves around the second person of the Trinity.</p>
<p><strong>4:6.</strong> “one God and Father of all.” This is the third triad and it speaks of God the Father. This marks the climax, for God is the one unifying factor in both testaments, in spite of the fact that many gods are honored in the world. … God is further described as the God and Father “of all,” which refers not to all humans but to all believers (John 1:12; Gal 3:26). This is substantiated in the present context because Paul is exhorting Christians, and not all humans, to preserve the unity.</p>
<p>Regarding the further identification of God, there are three parts. First, he is over (ἐπί) all, indicating his sovereign position over all believers. … Second, not only is God sovereign in all believers’ lives, he also works through (δία) all of them. Here the emphasis is on God’s immanence. … Finally, God is in all believers (ἐν πᾶσιν̓ ἡμῖν). This signifies the indwelling Spirit …, his intimate presence. <sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains my lecture notes for a guest lecture during a block class on Bibliology at <a href="http://www.foundationbaptistcollege.ca/">Foundation Baptist College</a> given on March 9, 2013.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>But among all our joys, there was no one that more filled our hearts, than the blessed continuance of the preaching of God’s sacred Word among us; which is that inestimable treasure, which excelleth all the riches of the earth; because the fruit thereof extendeth itself, not only to the time spent in this transitory world, but directeth and disposeth men unto that eternal happiness which is above in heaven.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Readers of the English Bible have had the privilege of “the blessed continuance of the preaching of God’s sacred Word” now for centuries, a blessing that is dependent upon popular access to reliable English translations. At the time that the King James translators wrote these words, there were a handful of English translations available to the relatively small proportion of the world’s population that spoke English.</p>
<p>Today, those circumstances have changed. Thanks to the growth of the British Empire in the Victorian era and today’s trend toward globalization, English now serves as the trade language for the world. This burgeoning market of English readers has created a demand for updated translations, and today there is such a proliferation of English Bibles on the market that publishers now use slick marketing campaigns as they compete for readership.</p>
<p>This lecture will attempt to explain how we arrived at this point from such humble beginnings. <!-- Include some learning objectives and more survey thoughts here about the overall outline of the article --></p>
<p>The history of the English Bible divides into three eras:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Medieval period (ca. 700–1500)</li>
<li>The English Reformation to the 19th century (ca. 1500–1900)</li>
<li>The 20th and 21st centuries (1901–2013)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="early-christian-heritage-of-the-british-isles">1.1. Early Christian heritage of the British Isles</h3>
<p>The story of the English Christianity begins under the Roman empire. Christian influence can be found in England as early as the first and second centuries<sup><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>, although it is unknown how Christianity arrived. These early Christians were wiped out when the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes pushed the Romans out of England during the early 5th century. Christianity carried on in the regions of Ireland and Scotland during this time under the leadership of men such as Patrick (5th century) in Ireland and Columba (6th century) in Scotland.</p>
<p>Eventually, Christianity reappeared in England in two competing streams. Missionaries from Scotland were first to arrive, establishing Celtic Christianity. Meanwhile, Roman Christianity was reestablished by Augustine of Canterbury (601–604), who was commissioned by Pope Gregory I (590–604).</p>
<p>Celtic Christianity established itself first in Lindisfarne (known as “the Holy Island”), under the leadership of Aidan ca. A.D. 635. The Celtic monks played an important role in the history of the English Bible and the history of educated Europe. The Lindisfarne monks produced the renowned <em>Lindisfarne Gospels,</em> a beautifully illuminated Latin edition that enabled them to preserve the knowledge of Latin after it was otherwise lost in continental Europe.</p>
<h3 id="medieval-english-bibles">1.2. Medieval English Bibles</h3>
<p>The language of the medieval church in the British Isles was Latin, but a few individuals translated portions of scripture into the common English tongue of the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around A.D. 650, Caedmon paraphrased parts of Genesis, Exodus, and Daniel. His work represents an early example of Anglo-Saxon poetry.</li>
<li>Around A.D. 735, Bede the Historian (primarily remembered for his <em>Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum,</em> “The Ecclesiastical History of the English People”) translated parts of the Gospels</li>
<li>In the late 800s, King Alfred the Great translated some of the Psalms and the 10 Commandments into Anglo-Saxon.</li>
<li>From A.D. 955–1020, Aelfric translated various books of the Bible into the English of his day.</li>
<li>In 1325, Richard Rolle and William of Shoreham translate psalms into metrical verse.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="john-wycliffe-and-the-lollards">1.3. John Wycliffe and the Lollards</h3>
<!-- Based on Cook, lectures 4 p 7 -->

<p>John Wycliffe was the great English reformer who predates the Reformation proper by 150 years and has very little help. He reaches a number of the same conclusions that Luther and Calvin would make much later. He lives from ca. 1320 to 1384, during the time of the Black Plague in England. He lives in a time of clerical ignorance, and desires to teach people to read the Bible for themselves. This is also during the period of the Babylonian Captivity of the papacy.</p>
<p>He gained his degree from Oxford, and preaches against the pope as the Anti-Christ at a young age. He writes a number of tracts against the pope, and sends young men to go from town to town to preach his doctrines. They were called the Lollards. One reason he was successful was his patronage of John of Gaunt, a relative of the King. In 1381 he drew up 12 theses declaring that the doctrine of the RCC was unscriptural, and then he began to translate the Bible into English. He did not know Greek and Hebrew, so he translated from the Latin.</p>
<p>Wycliffe’s theology can be found in his <em>Summa Theologica.</em> His core beliefs were as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The church consists of the elect. This was a novel concept to the church, which viewed all as subject to the pope.</li>
<li>He viewed the papacy as the anti-christ.</li>
<li>He viewed the priesthood as scandalous and immoral and incapable of effecting salvation.</li>
<li>Transubstantiation is a myth.</li>
<li>The scriptures are of supreme authority.</li>
</ol>
<p>He was very literal in his translation of scripture. He was more successful in Bohemia because of John Huss than he was in England. The Lollards were interesting people who would leave sections of the Scriptures in different villages. In 1401, Parliament passed an act aimed at the Lollards that gave the right to the civil authorities to burn heretics at the stake. Eventually, the Lollards who remained were incorporated into the Puritan movement. They were opposed to images, pilgrimages, etc.</p>

<!-- Brent Cook, lectures 5 p 7: -->

<p>Tyndale came from an obscure childhood. The one note we have from his youth is that while young he had read that King Alfred had produced a translation of the Bible. He went to Oxford, unlike the others. He was disturbed that he was not encouraged to read the Scriptures. He complained that they were not allowed to look at the Scriptures until after 8 or 9 years of indoctrination in doctrines which prevented understanding of the Bible. In 1516, he came to Cambridge. He probably joined the meetings at the White Horse Inn. He later became a private tutor for Sir John Walsh of Gloucestershire. He seems to have convinced Sir John that a good translation of the Bible was necessary.</p>
<p>He went outdoors to preach in the open air, and discovered that the Catholics created a rumor about him and attempted to ruin him. Distressed, he returned to Cambridge where he met an old scholar named William Latimer (no relation to Hugh). Latimer said to him: “Do you not know that the Pope is very anti-Christ, whom the Scriptures speaketh of? But beware of what you say, for if you say so publicly you will lose your life.” Tyndale never overcame this.</p>
<p>He was convinced that what England needed was a new translation of the Scripture. He found a man named Humphrey Monmouth who was interested in a translation of the Scripture and supported him. However, Monmouth advised him that England was not the best place to produce a translation. In 1524, Tyndale left all his goods with Monmouth and set sail for Hamburg. He did not know it, but he would never return. He is hard to track down at this point, because he is forever on the run. He printed Bibles in Cologne, but then quickly fled to Worms where he produced his first edition of the New Testament. He found German merchants who were all too glad to smuggle his Bibles into England. Eventually he wound up in Antwerp on the coast where it was easier to smuggle the Bibles back to England. In 1526 Bishop Tunstall ordered that all Tyndale Bibles were to be burned. It was too little too late. He wrote many other works, commentaries, The Obedience of a Christian Man, The Practice of the Prelates, and a great Dialogue with Thomas More. In all, he produced three editions of the New Testament until 1535. He then fell victim to a plot to lure him out of hiding. He was imprisoned in the Low Countries and ignored. Here he died on October 6, 1536. He was strangled and then his body burned at the stake. His last words, as they come down to us, were “Lord, Open the King of England’s eyes.” Ironically, his third edition was printed on the King’s press in England. Approximately 4/5 of this translation made it into the KJV.</p>
<h3 id="the-king-james-bible">2.2. The King James Bible</h3>
<p>The KJV was produced during the reign of James I of England. James I was already James VI of Scotland. His reign over England and Scotland lasted from the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 to his death in 1625.</p>
<p>At his ascension, England was plagued with a variety of problems, and there was religious unrest between the Calvinist Puritans and the Catholics. The Calvinists and Puritans thought he would favor them since he was Scottish after all. The Catholics thought he would favor them because his mother Mary was a good Catholic. In reality, the side he took was his own. He believed in the “divine right” of the monarchy, whereby the authority of the despot is directly given by God and he cannot be questioned. This view is that God ordained human government in the person of an individual king who is responsible for the nation. We see this view expressed in the actions of Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury during this time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The tension between the prelates of the official church and the Puritans grew during James’s reign. In 1604, Richard Bancroft, archbishop of Canterbury, had a series of canons approved in which it was affirmed that episcopal hierarchy was an institution of divine origin, and that without it there could be no true church. This implied a rejection of the many Protestant churches on the Continent that had no bishops, and therefore Puritans saw in it a step towards breaking away from Protestant ties in order to reintroduce Catholicism in England. Besides this, several other canons approved on the archbishop’s insistence were clearly directed against Puritans.<sup><a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story of the KJV begins when the Puritans came to James in 1604 with a “Millenary Petition” asking to move England in a Protestant direction. They hoped to establish Presbyterianism, institute freedom of worship, etc. They met him at the Hampton Court, and he refused all their requests (except the production of the <em>Authorized Version</em>).</p>
<p>James was not involved in the work of translation himself, but he did take an interest in it. Shortly after Hampton Court he instructed Archbishop Richard Bancroft (no friend of the Puritans, as we have seen) to contact all English churchmen requesting that they seek church positions for the translators, thus assuring them an income.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right trusty and well beloved, we greet you well. Whereas we have appointed certain learned men, to the number of 4 and 50, for the translating of the Bible, and in this number, divers of them have either no ecclesiastical preferment at all, or else so very small, as the same is far unmeet for men of their deserts and yet we in ourself in any convenient time cannot well remedy it, therefor we do hereby require you, that presently you write in our name as well to the Archbishop of York, as to the rest of the bishops of the province of Cant.[erbury] signifying unto them, that we do well, and straitly charge everyone of them … that (all excuses set apart) when we prebend or parsonage … shall next upon any occasion happen to be void … we may commend for the same some such of the learned men, as we shall think fit to be preferred unto it … Given unto our signet at our palace of West.[minister] on 2 and 20 July , in the 2nd year of our reign of England, France, and of Ireland, and of Scotland xxxvii.“<sup><a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="translation-process">2.2.1. Translation process</h4>
<p>The work of translation took place in two stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A Translation Committee translated sections of the Bible from 1604–1608.</li>
<li>The completed translation was evaluated by a General Committee of Review from 1609–1611.</li>
<li>The original printing of the Authorized Version was published by Robert Barker, the King’s Printer, in 1611 as a complete folio Bible. It was sold looseleaf for ten shillings, or bound for twelve.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="publication-history">2.2.2. Publication history</h4>
<p>By current standards, seventeenth-century book printing appears informal and unstandardized, and the early production history of the KJV includes a variety of well-known printer’s errors. These errors ranged in severity from comical typos (such as the “Printer’s Bible” and “Vinegar Bible”) to serious omissions (such as the “Wicked Bible”).</p>
<p>The publication history of the KJV can also be divided into stages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>KJV produced by the King’s Printer (1612–1617).</strong> “This short period sees no fewer than thirty printings of the KJB. Careless mistakes continue to be found and deliberate changes start to creep in.”<sup><a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>KJV produced by the Cambridge and Oxford University Presses (1629–1760).</strong> “This period marks the transition in the printing rights from the King’s Printer to the hands of the two university presses. it is a period in which the commercial benefits of being scholarly were occasionally realized. Both Oxford and Cambridge published two major editions (cambridge, 1629 and 1638; Oxford, 1675 and 1679). the great care of the editors of the cambridge editions contrasts sharply with that of the King’s Printer.”<sup><a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Attempts to standardize the KJV text (1762–1769).</strong> “By the mid-eighteenth century the wide variation in the various modernized reprints of the KJB, combined with all the notorious misprints, had reached the proportion of a scandal. eventually, the Universities of Oxford (Benjamin Blayney in 1769) and Cambridge (F. S. Parris in 1762) both sought to produce an updated standard text.”<sup><a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7">7</a></sup> Eventually, the Oxford standardization by Blayney became the accepted standard for the KJV text.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edited by Benjamin Blayney, the 1769 edition sought to overcome the numerous variants introduced by printing errors since 1611 and has since become the text of all modern editions of the KJV. To understand the types of changes Blayney made, consider these passages from the 1611 and 1769 text below (examples from Wikipedia).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 13:1-3 (1611)</strong> <sup>1</sup> Though I speake with the tongues of men &amp; of Angels, and haue not charity, I am become as sounding brasse or a tinkling cymbal. <sup>2</sup> And though I haue the gift of prophesie, and vnderstand all mysteries and all knowledge: and though I haue all faith, so that I could remooue mountaines, and haue no charitie, I am nothing. <sup>3</sup> And though I bestowe all my goods to feede the poore, and though I giue my body to bee burned, and haue not charitie, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1 Cor. 13:1-3 (1769)</strong> <sup>1</sup> Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. <sup>2</sup> And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. <sup>3</sup> And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The KJV eventually became the dominant English text. Wong notes that Blayney’s edition became dominant shortly after publication:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, almost all printings of the KJB have derived from the 1769 Oxford text—generally without Blayney’s variant notes and cross references, and commonly excluding the Apocrypha.<sup><a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Around the turn of the 19th century, a consensus began to develop that the archaic language of the KJV needed updating. This produced a number of different attempts to either 1) revise the KJV itself, or 2) produce a new translation using more contemporary English. Some of the more prominent attempts under each of these categories are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposed revisions of the KJV
<ol type="1">
<li>British Revised Version (RV; 1881–1885)</li>
<li>American Standard Version (ASV; 1901)</li>
<li>Revised Standard Version (RSV; 1952)</li>
<li>New King James Version (NKJV; 1982)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Fresh translations
<ol type="1">
<li>Jerusalem Bible (1966)</li>
<li>New American Bible and New English Bible (1970)</li>
<li>New American Standard Bible (1971)</li>
<li>Good News Bible (Today’s English Version; 1976)</li>
<li>New International Version (1978; minor update 1984)</li>
<li>New Jerusalem Bible (1985)</li>
<li>New Revised Standard Version (1990)</li>
<li>Update to the NASB (1995)</li>
<li>English Standard Version (2001)</li>
<li>Today’s New International Version (2005)</li>
<li>NET Bible (2005)</li>
