<p>Next week I’ll be speaking about the Protestant Reformation at <a href="http://foundationbaptistchurch.com/">Foundation Baptist Church</a> in Calgary. Below is some promotional information about the sessions. More information will be available on the <a href="http://blogs.duncanjohnson.ca/calgary-reformation-conference/">conference website</a>, where you can sign up for email updates.</p>
<p>Nearly 500 years ago, the events of the Protestant Reformation upended the western world. Our pursuit of God today is greatly helped by the rediscoveries of the Reformers. Because our doctrine depends on the discoveries of faithful men and women in the past, we need to know our family history. Come to our Fall Conference on the Reformation for an encouraging and edifying look at what those turbulent times of the past mean for us today. <!-- more --></p>
<p><strong>Sessions</strong></p>
<p>The Wednesday session and the Sunday session will be held at the Braeside Community Centre (11024 Braeside Dr. SW). The Thursday, Friday, and Saturday sessions will meet at a church member’s home. Please call the church office for directions (403-251-5920).</p>

	<id>http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2016/08/16/preachers-publishers-and-plagiarism</id>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just yesterday, a plagiarism incident was exposed that should cause all Christ’s church to pause and lament. And no, I’m not talking about whatever Melania Trump said at the Republican National Convention (which I didn’t watch)—though I partly wish I were instead.</p>
<p>The sad story I have in mind is <a href="http://www.eerdmans.com/Pages/Item/59043/Commentary-Statement.aspx">here on the Eerdmans website</a>, and I also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160816191752/http://www.eerdmans.com/Pages/Item/59043/Commentary-Statement.aspx">put a copy of it here on archive.org</a>. The press release states that respected New Testament scholar Peter T. O’Brien seems to have committed unintentional (but significant) plagiarism in his recent commentary on Hebrews and also (though to a lesser degree) in his works on Ephesians and Philippians. As a result, Eerdmans is taking all three titles out of print and offering credit to those who own copies. The author himself freely admits his error and issues an unqualified apology in the statement.</p>
<p>I’d like to use this incident to speak to the issue of pastoral ethics. Since I am writing so soon after hearing this news, I do not pretend to have reached a settled conclusion on all of the questions involved. But the exercise is important, I think, painful though it be.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest question here is what we should now do with O’Brien’s books. My own gut reaction, and that of many friends I’ve asked who are in pastoral ministry, is that while we certainly wouldn’t want to cite O’Brien’s work for academic research, we could probably still use it to study the biblical text personally and for preaching. Last night, I printed a copy of the Eerdmans statement to stick in the front of each book (I actually own <em>all three</em> of the discontinued titles), and wondered if I could just leave it at that.</p>
<p>But I’m not sure doing so fully appreciates what is actually at stake. Significantly, the Eerdmans statement does not tell us <em>what</em> material in these works has been plagiarised from <em>whom.</em> <a href="https://seanfwinter.com/2016/08/16/on-commentaries-and-plagiarism/">Sean Winter goes as far as to suggest an example in this post</a>, but as he also notes, the important question now is “what ought to happen to the various copies of these works that are still available to students in university and seminary libraries.”</p>
<p>I suspect that the results of the inquiry have been withheld at least partially because it is about the only thing Eerdmans can do to preserve something of O’Brien’s otherwise worthy reputation. (As an example of the respect with which O’Brien is held in the scholarly community, consider that he was honored with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gospel-Nations-Perspectives-Pauls-Mission/dp/0830815570">a Festschrift</a> including contributions from heavyweights such as D. A. Carson, Moisés Silva, Graeme Goldsworthy, and others.) Of course, it’s not really our business anyway, but not knowing what came from where creates other problems for us.</p>
<p>Certainly the ideas in these commentaries can still help us to understand the biblical text as we produce an exegetical sermon. But knowing that the commentary contains plagiarism means that, effectively, we cannot properly attribute any statement in these works to the original source. In other words, as long as I know that there is an attribution problem with these commentaries, I simply can’t cite anything from them and consider that to be a proper acknowledgment of the original source. Verbally acknowledging O’Brien as the source of an idea or statement would undermine my credibility to those who know about the problems in these works.</p>
<p>An important, and frightening, thing here is that merely changing a few words while preserving the basic structure and argument of a quoted source is not enough to avoid plagiarism. If your idea is not original to you, then you are responsible to show where you got it, unless it is demonstrable that your idea is “common knowledge.” A couple helpful resources for understanding what is (and isn’t) plagiarism include Andy Naselli’s <a href="http://andynaselli.com/on-plagiarism-an-interview-with-justin-taylor">interview with Justin Taylor</a> and <a href="http://www.plagiarism.org/plagiarism-101/what-is-plagiarism">this page on plagiarism.org</a>. I will not repeat these ideas here any further because doing so isn’t necessary. Oddly, though the definition of plagiarism may formally be “common knowledge,” it is also commonly misunderstood.</p>
<p>It’s certainly true that citation standards are somewhat different (at least in form) for sermons than in standard academic writing. But I believe that faithful preachers should still give some form of credit where it is due, even if it’s somewhat indirect—i.e., while I might say “as one commentator has said,” I would most definitely cite it in my written manuscript with something like, “(O’Brien, <em>Ephesians</em>, 323).” Even here I am not the first person to suggest this. The form of the words in this paragraph are my own, but <a href="http://preachingandpreachers.com/2016/06/24/stop-thief-should-i-have-put-that-in-quotes/">the idea probably comes from this post by Kerry McGonigal</a>—I honestly don’t even know.</p>
<p>And as we know, plagiarism in sermons is another huge problem of its own. I have heard of preachers who may have re-used sermon outlines from others without attribution. In my own experience, I remember approximately where I was in the pew when a guest preacher’s message suddenly seemed unusually eloquent—and after Googling a few of the key words that I had just heard on my smartphone, it was obvious that this preacher had lifted (without verbal acknowledgment) four or five paragraphs from a well-known blog. (For this and other reasons, I’ve stopped bringing my phone to church most Sunday mornings.)</p>
<p>So what should a conscientious (but also busy) pastor do? Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even when sermon preparation time is limited, consult multiple sources to avoid depending too much on the insights of one author. You already know that, but I know the very real pressure that comes from the fact that “Sunday is always coming.”</li>
<li>Use your own words as much as possible. If you can’t explain what your source says in your own words, you probably don’t understand the original idea that well anyway. (Although it’s true that often your source will express the idea better.)</li>
<li>When quoting or using another’s idea, acknowledge your source in some form verbally and in your written notes. You simply can’t be too careful, <a href="https://twitter.com/between2worlds/status/765395373653233665">as Justin Taylor has said</a>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> These days, there are <a href="https://blog.logos.com/2016/06/avoid-plagiarism-sermons-papers/">many</a> <a href="http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/zotero/2014/10/30/creating-citations-zotero.html">tools</a> available to make this easier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Preachers of the Bible which commands that “you shall not steal” (Exod. 20:15 ESV) should be especially careful to properly acknowledge their sources. We stand on the shoulders of many others who have studied God’s word before us. May God help us all to faithfully do that, and forgive us for the words we may have stolen unawares.</p>

<p>As you might have noticed, I’m still a newbie with video recording and production. Below are just a few notes to myself about the process of putting this video together, and hopefully I can learn from this next time I need to do something in front of a camera.</p>
<ul>
<li>The lighting wasn’t perfect. You can see above that we tried to have some indirect lighting with the lamp and the poster board on a chair. As it turned out, it was really hard to get that close enough to my face to make a significant difference while keeping it out of the camera frame.</li>
<li>Despite the lavalier mic and the mixer plugged into my laptop, the volume levels still weren’t right. In the end, I used the audio captured by the camcorder anyway because the lav mic wasn’t recorded loud enough. I’m not sure why that was, but more time spent testing the setup could have made a big difference here. I suspect the fact that we connected the laptop to the “headphone out” port on the mixer might have been part of the problem, but I’m really not sure.</li>
<li>I really should have spent another five minutes fiddling with getting the TV (which I used as a teleprompter) right behind the camera. Having it off to the side even just a bit means that I never look at the camera, and that just looks weird.</li>
<li>Using the projector screen as an even white backdrop worked out pretty well, although it’s a little on the boring side, I guess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, I still have lots to learn about video production. I’m just glad that I’m done with it for now.</p>]]></content>

<p>Last week while reading <a href="http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2016/05/20/book-review-pentecostal-outpourings-revival-and-the-reformed-tradition/">Pentecostal Outpourings</a>, I went back and reviewed this video where D.A. Carson and Tim Keller discuss the topic of revival. Here are some notes from my Evernote file on the video, which is certainly worth 12 minutes of your time.</p>
<p>In the video Carson mentions that he has two personal resolutions should he ever encounter real revival in his own experience:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have as little to do with the media as possible, and</li>
<li>Funnel the energy of the revival into good, systematic preaching and teaching rather than endless recounting of experience. This is because the experience itself can become an idol that is detached from Scripture.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shortly after that, Keller contrasts about the Reformed view of revival with “the other view.” He describes the Reformed view of revival as an intensification of the ordinary operations of the Spirit. These include conviction of sin, conversion, giving assurance, sanctification. The other view defines it as the extraordinary work of the Holy Spirit. When a sleepy Christian wakes up, they become more humble because they are more convicted of sin, and also more confident because they’re less concerned about what people think about them. This makes a potent evangelist. While he describes this view, Carson chimes in to observe that true revival is not something that your organize, or turn on according to a predetermined set of criteria. However, God does bring revival, and he can do it again.</p>
<p>So what should we do? <a href="http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2016/05/20/book-review-pentecostal-outpourings-revival-and-the-reformed-tradition/">As many others have pointed out</a>, Keller notes that revival is sought through prayer. He compares it to building an altar and asking God to send fire. This is done by faithful preaching of the gospel, extraordinary prayer, leaders who model a renewed life, a few converts who are willing to open their mouths. Sometimes the fire comes in big ways, sometimes in small ways. Usually revival starts well, but ends poorly. However, we should still be seeking and asking for true revival.</p>]]></content>

<p>Smart, Robert Davis, Michael A. G. Haykin, and Ian Hugh Clary, eds. <em>Pentecostal Outpourings: Revival and the Reformed Tradition.</em> Grand Rapids, MI: Reformation Heritage Books, 2016. ISBN 9781601784339. 280 pages.</p>
<p>Nearly all Christians say that they desire “true revival,” but few agree on what that phrase means. Evangelicals sometimes distinguish between “revival” and “reformation,” associating the former with individual spiritual renewal (usually through mass conversions) and the latter with outward societal change. Furthermore, many evangelicals will contrast “true (or genuine) revival” with “false revival.” Iain Murray captures this contrast in his well-known work entitled <em>Revival and Revivalism.</em> What is it that distinguishes between true revival and the excesses of revivalism? Should Christians pray for revival? How should they seek it, and what should they expect when it comes?</p>
<p>These questions are particularly vexing for those within the Reformed tradition. <em>Pentecostal Outpourings: Revival and the Reformed Tradition</em> brings together a coterie of Reformed historians to argue that true revival is not merely compatible with Calvinistic theology, but that historical revivals have been heavily influenced by Reformed preaching and represents a consistent understanding of the true gospel. Despite the real and lasting results of these revivals, the historical record is difficult to interpret because true revivals have often included mixed reports of unnerving enthusiasm or manipulative revivalistic tactics. Parsing these confusing elements requires a foundational understanding of true revival, defined as follows by Robert Davis Smart in the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Pentecostal Outpourings</em> demonstrates that revival is a sovereign gift from God in which, for a special season, His normal and true work of advancing His kingdom is sped up or quickened so that more is accomplished through His servants in a shorter period of time. Revivals cannot be merited by us but have been secured by another—Jesus Christ. Jesus tells His disciples that His righteous life and atoning death won for us “the promise of My Father” (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4). When Jesus ascended to the Father and sat down at the right hand of God, He poured out His Holy Spirit at Pentecost. This once-for-all historical and redemptive event was not the last time Christ poured out His Spirit in redemptive history. Subsequent outpourings of the Holy Spirit, working by and with the Word, are reviewed in this volume in order that we may seek God earnestly to revive His church once again soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each chapter in <em>Pentecostal Outpourings</em> focuses on the history of revivals within a particular area and denominational tradition and is written by a specialist. As a result, the chapters provide detailed and reliable historical scholarship tracing the impact of revivals, usually beginning with the “Evangelical Revival” or “Great Awakening” and carrying forward through twentieth century. In some cases, chapters conclude with an extended theological analysis of the historical events (<em>e.g.</em>, the chapter by Eifon Evans on the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists). Each well-written chapter includes numerous historical examples from individual conversion narratives, the writings of revival preachers, and contemporary historical records. A few of these memorable stories include the remarkable revival stirred by the harsh preaching of “crazy James Glendinning” in Ireland, the eventual misappropriation of Jonathan Edwards’s revival apologetic by later revivalists, and Andrew Fuller’s growth out of hyper-Calvinism to the zealously evangelistic Calvinism that eventually led to William Carey’s missionary endeavors. Of course, these are but a few highlights, and the time would fail me to tell you about the countless ordinary believers who came to lasting faith in Christ through the revival preaching that is recounted in this volume. To fully appreciate these revival stories, you just have to read the book.</p>
<p>Many similarities stand out in these accounts of revivals which took place in vastly different locations, among divergent denominational traditions, and at different times. It is immediately obvious that true revival is no respecter of denominations. It occurs, often without warning or harbinger, wherever and whenever God pleases according to His sovereign plan. Genuine and lasting revival cannot be manufactured, yet many times it does occur amongst people who have earnestly prayed for it. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to distinguish between true revival and excessive emotional enthusiasm, which many times occur simultaneously. Careful pastors who are aware of this repeatedly seek to steer their people towards the Scriptures in an effort to curb excesses.</p>
<p>Those who read this book will be forced to reflect on their own relationship to God’s providential work. Evangelical Christians will come away from this work with a renewed longing for genuine revival, resulting in earnest prayer and renewed passion for faithful preaching and teaching of the Bible. But I suspect that even readers who are not evangelicals may be drawn to this volume, perhaps curious about evangelical claims of divine intervention. Although this book alone won’t be sufficient to overcome agnostic doubts, such readers will find such striking similarities in the genuine revival accounts that they may be driven further in a search to evaluate the claims of the Christian gospel itself.</p>

	<updated>2016-04-13T09:44:00-06:00</updated>
	<id>http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2016/04/13/advice-for-marking-student-papers</id>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my teaching, I frequently ask students to write research reports using the Turabian style guide. Of course, many students dislike having to follow the seemingly meticulous conventions for citations and formatting. I can understand that, but I tell them that the particulars are not the point—formal writing conventions exist to facilitate the interchange of ideas by providing a common format for displaying one’s work in an intelligible manner. In other words, it’s for the reader, which is the whole point. Besides, once a student masters the proper use of <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, it’s not that difficult.</p>
<p>Once I get the papers back, I’ve always become bogged down myself. Nobody ever taught me how to mark a paper, so I’ve tried all kinds of different approaches. Still, I usually wound up spending way too many hours on it, and of course, most of that time involved trying to show students why they can’t violate all the known conventions of English grammar and still be understood by readers. That’s not really helpful to anybody, actually.</p>
<p>Anyway, yesterday while I was in the middle of marking some papers, I thought I’d double-check to make sure that Turabian 8 was still the most recent edition of Turabian. On the <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/books/turabian/manual/index.html">University of Chicago Press website for Turabian</a>, I found a PDF guide called “How to Teach Turabian” that includes a brief section called “A Quick Guide to Marking Student Papers.” It had never occurred to me that there would be guides on marking papers, and now I see that I’ve been doing this the wrong way for years.</p>
<p>Here are the guidelines for marking student papers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Distinguish <em>marking</em> papers (a learning outcome) from <em>grading</em> papers (an evaluation outcome).</li>
<li>Let students help you decide when to mark their papers.</li>
<li>When you don’t respond, students can learn from their peers.</li>
<li>Don’t mark as you read.</li>
<li>In marking, less is more.</li>
<li>Have a learning agenda for your marks.</li>
<li>Mark papers “top-down.”</li>
<li>Don’t penalize good papers by leaving them unmarked.</li>
<li>The most effective marks focus on a reader’s response, not on the writer’s success or failure.</li>
<li>The most effective marks about writing have three parts: they (1) point out the specific issue on the page, (2) articulate the relevant general principle, and (3) suggest a change or, better, direct the student to make a change.</li>
<li>The most effective marks about argument—“content”—have three parts: they (1) point out the specific issue on the page, (2) explain what gives you pause, and (3) make a suggestion or, better, ask a question pointing the student in a new direction.</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting in January, I’ll be teaching through the books of Galatians and Romans in my adult Sunday School class at my church. This post is an expanded version of a blurb I wrote about the class for a church bulletin.</p>
<p>Paul’s letters to the Galatians and the Romans focus on the essential core of the gospel message—salvation as justification by faith alone. In Galatians, Paul describes the believer’s new life in Christ as a result of our co-crucifixion on the cross of our loving savior Christ:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>ESV</sup> <strong>Gal. 2:20</strong> I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Romans expands this theme, giving us a theology of the cross that allows us to be “justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Rom 3:24). Because God’s righteous wrath for our sins has been poured out on Christ as our sinless substitute, His justice is satisfied and He has passed over our guilt (Rom 3:25).</p>
<p>Focused as they are on the gospel of grace in Christ, these two books have had immeasurable influence on Christian theology throughout the history of the church. Beginning in January, my Sunday School class will begin with a study of Galatians which will take us until Easter, and then we will begin working through Romans (which will take us until at least mid-summer).</p>

<p>Study copies of the biblical text will be provided in class. Those who would like to go further on their own during the week are encouraged to pick up a copy of <em>Galatians: A 12-Week Study</em> by Geoff Ziegler (Crossway, 2015) in the <em>Knowing the Bible</em> series, which is <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?event=AFF&amp;p=1178855&amp;item_no=543029">available from christianbook.com for about $8</a>.</p>]]></content>

<p><em>In my recent class on the Psalms, we made a practice of praying the Psalms together at the beginning of each class session. The following is an excerpt from my lecture notes for that class where I introduce the concept of praying the words of Scripture.</em></p>
<p>Don Whitney has recently written a book titled <em>Praying the Bible</em> (Crossway, 2015) which compiles a lot of the things he’s learned about praying using Scripture over several years of thinking and teaching about this topic.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen the book itself—I’m sure it’s helpful, but I also think that I may not need the book itself to grow in my own prayer life. Fortunately for us, Crossway has released a number of helpful, free online resources to promote the book. I’ve listed some of these resources at the end of this post in the “For Further Study” section. In this interview below, Don Whitney shares a number of ideas about praying the Bible:</p>

<p>HT: <a href="http://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justintaylor/2015/08/13/a-conversation-with-don-whitney-on-praying-the-bible/">Justin Taylor</a></p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.crossway.org/blog/2015/07/praying-the-bible-vs-interpreting-the-bible/">excerpt from the book available online</a>, Whitney makes a helpful observation about how we can use the text of Scripture in our prayers. He sees a distinction between studying the Bible, where the primary goal is to understand the meaning of the text, and praying the Bible, where we use the text of Scripture to speak about the normal things of daily life. There are some practical benefits to this way of thinking, as he explains below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me use a ridiculous illustration to make the point. Suppose you are praying through Psalm 130, and you come to verse 3: “If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?” And when you see that verb “mark,” your friend Mark comes to mind. What should you do? Pray for Mark! You know that verse is not about Mark, but it’s certainly not wrong to pray for Mark just because he popped into your head as you were reading Psalm 130:3.</p>
<p>Here’s a more realistic illustration. Let’s turn to Psalm 23:3. “He restores my soul.” One of the things this verse might prompt you to pray for is the salvation of a person with whom you are trying to share the gospel, to pray that God would restore that person’s soul from darkness to light, from death to life. If I were to <em>preach</em> on Psalm 23 and say, “This verse is about evangelism; about God restoring the souls of those in spiritual darkness,” I would be sinning. That verse is not about evangelism, and I know it. It’s about a believer’s soul being restored to the joy of God’s salvation. Were I to declare to others that God’s Word here means one thing when I know it means another would be, at best, to misuse the text. We never have the right to claim that the Bible says something it does not.</p>
<p>But if, while you are <em>praying</em> through Psalm 23:3, your non-Christian friend comes to mind, and you use the language of this verse—“Lord restore my friend’s soul; restore him from darkness to light, from death to life”—that’s fine. This isn’t reading something into the text; it’s merely <em>using the language</em> of the text to speak to God about what has come into your mind.</p>
<p>So, again, simply turn every thought Godward as you read the passage. At some points you will pray exactly what the text is about, as when you pray, “Lord, restore my soul to the joy of your salvation.” At other times you will use biblical language to pray thoughts unrelated to the text that come to you while reading the text, as in, “Lord restore my non-Christian friend’s soul from death to life.”</p>
</blockquote>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://duncanjohnson.ca/images/2014/12/whitefield.jpg"></p>
<p>On 16 December 1714 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates">O.S.</a>), George Whitefield was born at the Bell Inn, Southgate Street, Gloucester. This past week, his birthday was commemorated on Twitter with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Whitefield300">#Whitefield300</a> at the suggestion of <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasSKidd/status/539919555921862656">Whitefield biographer Thomas Kidd</a>.</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> to archive the tweet stream. At first, I was just appending the tweets to an Evernote file. When I set that up, I didn’t know that IFTTT is limited to only 30 updates to Evernote per hour, which obviously didn’t work out too well once the volume picked up on the morning of December 16. Once I realized what was going on, I set up a Google Sheet to collect the tweet stream, and this seems to have been much more reliable.</p>
<p>Below is my attempt to compile some of the resources available on Whitefield, including links to my Google Sheet and Evernote file. If I have missed anything of significance, please drop me a line (email <a href="mailto:djohnson@foundationbaptistcollege.ca">duncan-at-duncanjohnson-dot-ca</a> or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/dtjohnso">@dtjohnso</a>) and I’ll be glad to update the list.</p>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://duncanjohnson.ca/images/2014/12/tn_4850.png"></p>
<p>Bebbington, David W. <em>Baptists through the Centuries: A History of a Global People.</em> Waco, TX: Baylor University Press, 2010.</p>
<p>This book was runner-up in my textbook adoption process for my Baptist history course. I have not yet read this book in full, but I have found portions of this book to be helpful as I prepared lectures. I chose not to select this book as required course reading for two reasons:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Published as it is by Baylor University Press, it costs slightly more than Leonard.</li>
<li>Bebbington follows a <em>synthetic</em> rather than <em>chronological</em> approach to the details of Baptist history. He describes the synthetic approach in the paragraph quoted below.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is primarily a work of synthesis that attempts to put the pieces of the puzzle into an intelligible framework. Its approach, therefore, is topical. In accordance with the maxim that it is better to study problems rather than periods, each chapter addresses an issue in Baptist history. … A second feature of the book is its effort to set the problems at hand in a wider context than Baptist history. Baptists did not exist alone, and so the analysis gives space to the broader influences—intellectual, social, and political—that played on religious developments. … The third aspect worth mentioning is the principle of organization. Countries are not kept apart, for that misrepresents the reality of the past. For all the contrasts between different nations, Baptists traveled between them, read each other’s writings, and corresponded across oceans. What happened in one part of the world was often duplicated elsewhere.” (pp. 4–5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach is self-evident when you look at the chapter titles, listed below:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Roots in the Reformation</li>
<li>Anabaptists and Baptists</li>
<li>Particular and General Baptists in the Seventeenth Century</li>
<li>Baptists and Revival in the Eighteenth Century</li>
<li>Divisions among Baptists in the Nineteenth Century</li>
<li>Theological Polarization among Baptists</li>
<li>Baptists and the Social Gospel</li>
<li>Gospel and Race among Baptists</li>
<li>Women in Baptist Life</li>
<li>Church, Ministry, and Sacraments among Baptists</li>
<li>Baptists and Religious Liberty</li>
<li>Baptists and Foreign Mission</li>
<li>The Global Spread of the Baptists</li>
<li>Baptist Identity</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>There is certainly plenty of merit for the use of a synthetic approach to historical study, and I’ve benefited immensely from reading other works that follow this approach (in fact, <em>Turning Points</em> by Noll is highly synchronic in some chapters). However, I don’t think a synthetic approach would work well for beginning students who had no general chronological framework into which to plug the disparate concepts a synthetic study would bring to the surface. However, for readers with a general familiarity with the Baptist story, Bebbington’s work may prove a refreshing approach. The synthetic approach is somewhat of a current trend in historiography, but I was encouraged to find that others share my relative antipathy towards it as a practice. For instance, John Aloisi (Assistant Professor of Historical Theology at Detroit Baptist Theological Seminary), gave the following recommendation for this book on <a href="http://dbts.edu/blog/learning-about-the-past-exploring-baptist-history/">his blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book is a very interesting read…. Although described by the publisher as “a chronological survey” (back cover), Bebbington’s work is largely arranged in a topical format that can be be helpful though it also has the potential to be a bit disorienting at times. For example, I found it rather odd to read about William Carey almost 100 pages after Walter Rauschenbusch when Carey was born exactly 100 years before Rauschenbusch. Similarly, the book includes a chapter titled “Women in Baptist Life” (ch. 10). I wondered, why not just discuss key Baptist women at appropriate points in the historical narrative (e.g., in the first nine chapters)? I don’t see a compelling reason for making that topic a distinct chapter. A similar observation could be made about the chapter on religious liberty (ch. 12). On the other hand, if one wants to read an insightful chapter on these topics or on things like Baptists and the social gospel (ch. 8) or Baptists and race relations (ch. 9), Bebbington is a very good place to turn. Overall, Bebbington’s work is definitely helpful and well worth reading, but the potential reader should realize that Bebbington doesn’t tell the story of Baptist history in anything like a chronological narrative. So I’m recommending it with the caveat that if you like to read history in a generally chronological format, Bebbington may drive you crazy. But if you want to read about some key topics in Baptist history, this is a helpful book by a first rate historian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So anyway, if you’re glazed over with all this rambling about historiography, let me just bring this back to a point of usefulness by sharing Bebbington’s own statements summing up the overall point of the book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This book attempts to address the question of who Baptists have been over the four centuries of their existence. It tries to take account of ways in which they adapted to the societies in which they lived as well as their central practices. … [I]t must not be assumed that Baptists possessed a single, consistent identity. There were, after all, many types of Baptists. … The variety of Christian bodies called ‘Baptist’ has to be taken into account. So does the consideration that there was great deal of change over time. The circumstances of the early seventeenth century, when Baptists first arose, were very different from those of the early twenty-first century. It was a hallmark of the denomination to be strongly attached to the Bible, but ways of understanding the place of scripture in ordering church life altered over the centuries. Again there was much variation over space.” (p. 2)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The coverage of this book extends not just over England in the period from 1609 to the present but also over the world at large. … There is, therefore, a need for Baptist history to have an international dimension. Because research on many countries (including some of the nations just mentioned) is at a very preliminary stage, there are all too many gaps in the coverage of the present volume. The aim here is not to deal with every country where Baptists have existed, but to discuss broad trends with representative instances.” (pp. 3-4)</p>

	<updated>2014-11-08T22:05:00-07:00</updated>
	<id>http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2014/11/08/doctrine-of-assurance</id>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This Sunday in my Adult Sunday School class, I’ll be taking advantage of a scheduled break in our <a href="http://www.meadowlandsbaptist.ca/resources/adult-bible-study-notes/">regular teaching schedule</a>. We just finished teaching through First, Second, and Third John last week, and will be beginning a study of John’s Gospel on November 16. To take advantage of the break in between books, I plan to focus on a topic that frequently arises in 1 John: assurance of salvation.</p>
<p>In the Sunday School class, we’ll be working through a number of Bible passages as they are presented in chapter 40 of Wayne Grudem’s <em>Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine</em> (available from <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0310286700/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=0310286700&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=duncanjohns04-20">Amazon.ca</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0310286700/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0310286700&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=duncanandmego-20&amp;linkId=KLSMSU5FI4DCES5J">Amazon.com</a>, or <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?event=AFF&amp;p=1178855&amp;item_no=620882">CBD</a>). His organization is helpful, and I find his comments on Hebrews 6:4–12 particularly useful. I’d recommend this chapter to anyone who is interested in a thorough understanding of Scripture on this topic.</p>
<p>Another helpful resource is a brief blog series from Tim Challies. While I wouldn’t express everything exactly as he did, of course, his thoughts are helpful (and free!):</p>

</figure>
<p>Haykin, Michael A. G. <em>Rediscovering the Church Fathers: Who They Were and How They Shaped the Church.</em> Wheaton: Crossway, 2011. ISBN 9781433510434. 172 pages. Includes index.</p>
<p>In this book, Haykin combines his remarkable knowledge of the earliest period of church with his zeal for heart-warming devotional Christianity to produce a work that both informs and edifies.</p>
<p>Haykin writes to counter the fact that, in his view, “far too many modern-day evangelicals are either ignorant of or quite uncomfortable with the church fathers” (13). In this regard, he observes, that “<em>certain</em> strains of anti-intellectual fundamentalism have discouraged an interest in that ‘far country’ of church history” (14, my emphasis). He understands that this problem is not entirely due to bad reasons, however, because our “desire to be ‘people of the Book’—an eminently worthy desire—has also led to a lack of interest in other students of Scripture from that earliest period of the church’s history after the apostolic era” (14). Despite this trend, Haykin argues that we should read the church fathers for several reasons. We should read them for “freedom and wisdom,” to understand the New Testament, because of bad press about them, to aid in defending the faith, and for spiritual nurture. In the book, Haykin’s goal is to spark our interest in reading more of the fathers “by looking at several case studies, as it were” (29). These case studies serve to introduce important themes in both the early history of the church and the development of cardinal doctrines. As such, this book is not a comprehensive survey of the fathers, a feature that is apparent by the fact that although there are chapters on many important fathers, some of the most important (like Athanasius and Augustine) are actually left out.</p>
<p>Table of Contents:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Rediscovering the Church Fathers: A Vital Need for Evangelicals</li>
<li>Dying for Christ: The Thought of Ignatius of Antioch</li>
<li>Sharing the Truth: <em>The Letter to Diognetus</em></li>
<li>Interpreting the Scripture: The Exegesis of Origen</li>
<li>Being Kissed: The Eucharistic Piety of Cyprian and Ambrose</li>
<li>Being Holy and Renouncing the World: The Experience of Basil of Caesarea</li>
<li>Saving the Irish: The Mission of Patrick</li>
<li>Walking with the Church Fathers: My First Steps on a Lifelong Journey</li>
</ol>
<p>Appendix 1: Reading the Fathers: A Beginner’s Guide Appendix 2: Reflections on Jaroslav Pelikan, <em>The Emergence of the Catholic Tradition (100–600)</em></p>
<p>I would like to share just a few comments on how some of these chapters impacted me, without going into a summary of each individual chapter or a discussion of major themes that build throughout the book.</p>
<p>Many (if not all) of these chapters nurtured me spiritually. One of Haykin’s many research interests is the study of Christian spirituality, a topic that is the focus of a festschrift in his honor titled <em>The Pure Flame of Devotion: The History of Christian Spirituality</em> (edited by Weaver and Clary). This emphasis shines throughout the book, but I was particularly encouraged by Ignatius’ steadfast anticipation of his own martyrdom and Patrick’s dogged commitment to evangelizing his former captors in western Ireland.</p>
<p>As I expected, many of the chapters deepened my appreciation for the precise formulations of orthodoxy that we enjoy as a result of the diligent efforts forged by these men in times of doctrinal controversy. The chapters on the <em>Letter to Diognetus</em> and Basil of Caesarea were especially helpful in that regard.</p>
<p>On another note, my understanding was transformed by his chapter on Origen. I did not realize it, but I had allowed bad press on the Fathers to distort my understanding of their abilities. I began reading the chapter assuming that Origen’s famous penchant for allegory would mean that there would be little for me to learn about biblical interpretation. But I realized that my understanding of Origen was tinted by a gross misunderstanding. Rather than reading about a half-crazed mystic who simply allowed his imagination to run wild whenever he encountered something he didn’t immediately understand in the biblical text, I learned that Origen was a deeply devoted student of Scripture who understood that allegorical interpretations were not always appropriate (81–82). In fact, Origen actually affirmed three uses for the literal meaning of Scripture, rather than seeing it all as a deeply spiritual parable of something other than what it actually says, and said that the interpreter “should not resort too easily” to allegory (84). Although Origen is perhaps the best-known implementer of the patristic penchant for allegory, he only employed it when he felt it was appropriate, and he articulated principles for the appropriate use of allegory (85–86). Coming away from this chapter, I realized that I have misunderstood the church fathers and their use of allegory because I had not been listening to them. Instead, I had been allowing my own bias (which came from bad press) to keep me from a fair analysis of the facts.</p>]]></content>

</figure>
<p>I am looking forward to attending the annual conference for the Andrew Fuller Center for Baptist Studies this year on “George Whitefield and the Great Awakening.”</p>
<p>Here is the introduction from the <a href="http://events.sbts.edu/andrewfuller/">conference website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>George Whitefield was not only the most celebrated preacher of the eighteenth century, but he was also a central figure in the creation of modern Evangelicalism. His emphasis on the new birth, his passion for evangelism, his ability to cross denominational boundaries and build networks of Christians based on the gospel and Reformation convictions were central features in what we know today as Evangelicalism. In this conference celebrating the tercentennial (1714) birth of Whitefield, we will explore these key themes of this remarkable Christian’s life and what they meant for his day and mean for ours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the session titles, taken from the <a href="http://www.andrewfullercenter.org/conference/george-whitefield-and-the-great-awakening-october-21-22-2014/">tentative schedule posted on the AFCBS blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Session 1: “The Calvinism of George Whitefield” (Thomas S. Kidd)<br />
Session 2: “George Whitefield: Anglican evangelist” (Lee Gatiss)<br />
Session 3: “George Whitefield &amp; the Wesleys” (Stephen Nichols)<br />

<p>As another neat bonus, a few days ago I received my copy of Thomas Kidd’s new biography titled <em>George Whitefield: America’s Spiritual Founding Father</em> (ISBN 9780300181623). I’m looking forward to digging into this book over the next few days. The hardcover is available from <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0300181620/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=0300181620&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=duncanjohns04-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.christianbook.com/Christian/Books/product?event=AFF&amp;p=1178855&amp;item_no=181623">CBD</a>, and there is also a <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00O56PTU6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B00O56PTU6&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=duncanjohns04-20">Kindle version</a> available.</p>]]></content>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>This book takes an unusual, and interesting, approach to telling the story of the church by focusing on key turning points throughout the church’s history. Noll describes this approach as “one of the most interesting ways to grasp a general sense of Christian history” (2). The process of identifying these turning points is necessarily subjective, yet he argues that it yields several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>“It provides an opportunity to select… and so to bring some order into a massively complicated subject.”</li>
<li>It provides “an opportunity to highlight, to linger over specific moments so as to display the humanity, the complexity, and the uncertainties that constitute the actual history of the church, but that are so often obscured in trying to recount the sweep of centuries.”</li>
<li>It provides “an opportunity to interpret, to state more specifically why certain events, actions, or incidents may have marked an important fork in the road or signaled a new stage in the outworking of Christian history.” (2)</li>
</ul>
<p>The turning points Noll chose can be seen in the table of contents, seen below. <em>[N.B.: The numbers in parentheses for each chapter are dates, not page numbers.]</em></p>

</ol>
<p>Afterword: The Character of Christianity and the Search for Turning Points</p>
<hr />
<p>Noll emphasizes that “the fourteen turning points singled out for special attention … are by no means the only ones that could have been selected” (3). He explains that the process of selection itself is an important and useful exercise, and notes that “if the book inspires others to think about why the turning points found here are not as important as other possibilities, it will have been a successful book” (4). He then briefly outlines the structure of each chapter, noting that he always begins with “a relatively detailed account of the turning point itself” followed by more theoretical discussions of “why, how, and so what” (4). Additionally, each chapter features a hymn and a prayer from the general time period of the chapter as well as several longer quotations from people involved in the events of the chapter.</p>
<p>After explaining the structure and nature of the book, Noll takes up a larger question: why be concerned about church history at all? Noll offers several reasons why the study of church history is valuable.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“Studying the history of Christianity provides repeated, concrete demonstration concerning the irreducibly historical character of the Christian faith” (5).</li>
<li>It “provide[s] perspective on the interpretation of Scripture” (6).</li>
<li>“The study of church history is also useful as a laboratory for examining Christian interactions with surrounding culture” (7).</li>
<li>Because “God sustains the church despite the church’s own frequent efforts to betray its Savior and its own high calling, … study of the past can be useful … in shaping proper Christian attitudes” (8).</li>
</ol>
<p>In the introduction, Noll mentions a few of his own convictions which influence his portrayal of the events of church history. He generally prefers the term “history of Christianity” over “church history,” partly because he believes that “‘Christianity’ means something definite with boundaries that are fairly well defined by the major creeds.” Beyond that, Noll writes with “evangelical Protestant convictions” that “lead [him] to think that revitalized forms of Reformation faith are the truest and best forms of Christianity” (9–10). Noll qualifies this belief, however, with the observation that “historical study has convinced me that confessional Protestants have sometimes honored the ideals of the Reformation more in words than in reality. Historical study also shows that believers in other Christian traditions regularly display Christlike virtues and practice humble dependence upon God’s grace more than my confessional Protestant convictions tell me they should.” As a result, he has “tried to write with as much respect as possible for the widely diverse forms of Christianity that have been practiced with integrity, and continue to be practiced with integrity, in all parts of the Christian church” (10).</p>
<p>Of course, Noll’s statements regarding Catholicism reflect his perspective as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicals_and_Catholics_Together#Endorsed_By">endorser of <em>Evangelicals and Catholics Together</em> in 1994</a>. I think it is useful to read authors from outside my own tradition, but that does not obviate the need to read with discernment.</p>
<p>Noll’s book is helpful for a number of different reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>By approaching the history of Christianity from the vantage point of key turning points, he provides an interesting and unusual perspective. This also enables the chapters to stand on their own while still making sense to a reader who reads the book through from beginning to end.</li>
<li>Noll’s writing style is simultaneously lucid and dense. He is capable of drawing complex connections between seemingly unrelated events, yet throughout the process his ideas remain incredibly clear. My students all said that they enjoyed his writing, but that he always forced them to think carefully.</li>
<li><p>Over the course of the book, he develops several key ideas into recurring themes. One example appears in Chapter 1, where he argues that the fall of Jerusalem created a new problem for the Christian church. Suddenly severed from any connection to its Jewish roots, the church was forced to emerge as an independent entity while maintaining a connection to its apostolic roots. The need to establish <em>apostolicity</em> could be resolved in three different ways: by appealing to the authority of the New Testament canon, by appealing to the authority of the emerging episcopacy, or by appealing to the authority of the apostolic creeds. What is interesting about these three distinct sources of stability is that Protestants, Roman Catholics, and the Orthodox each tend to place more emphasis on one of those three, as displayed in the chart below:</p>
<table style="width:56%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 30%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Tradition</th>
<th>Stabilizing Element</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Protestants</p></td>
<td><p>Canon</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Roman Catholics</p></td>
<td><p>Episcopacy</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Orthodox</p></td>
<td><p>Creed</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As the history of the church progresses through time, Noll quite effectively shows how these three contrasting sources of authority shape future conflicts within the church.</p>
<p>Another example of a recurring theme throughout the book is the concept of <em>Christendom,</em> the idea which began to develop in the post-Roman European world that Christ’s kingdom extended to a specific geographical location (Europe), and that thus church and state ought to be deeply entwined. The idea of Christendom appears to climax in the coronation of Charlemagne, and much of the spiritual and political energy of the Medieval period is wrapped up in preserving that (un)holy (un)Roman (un)Empire.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although each chapter is interesting and carefully researched, it does become evident that some chapters play more to Noll’s strengths than others. From time to time, he indicates in a footnote that he is depending upon another secondary source for much of his material in a chapter. In other chapters where the subject material is within an area where he has done extensive research, he writes with considerably more freedom as he draws upon his own extensive knowledge. An example of one of his stronger chapters is chapter 10 on the Evangelical Revival under the Wesleys (his name appears twice in the “Further Reading” section at the end of the chapter), and an example of one of his weaker chapters is chapter 9 on the Jesuits. Still, his skills as a researcher shine throughout, and there is a remarkable uniformity of quality throughout.</p>]]></content>

	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every now and then, you hear somebody preach a sermon that really sticks in your memory. For me, this happened when I heard <a href="http://www.sermonaudio.com/sermoninfo.asp?SID=32111153492">this sermon</a> by Brent Cook in chapel at Bob Jones University. The message takes 1 Cor. 1:18 as its foundational text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. (1 Corinthians 1:18 NKJ)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I replayed this sermon for my students in my class on evangelism a year later (the link above goes to the website for that course), and I’ve listened to this message many times since. It came to mind again today as I was studying 2 Cor. 2:12–3:18.</p>]]></content>

<p>I just read a little booklet by J. C. Ryle. Titled <em>Simplicity in Preaching: A Few Short Hints on a Great Subject</em>, the book contains a lecture Ryle delivered in 1882 and spans 48 tiny pages (each page includes only a couple paragraphs). I suspect that the entire thing would work today as a lengthy blog post.</p>
<p>Much of what Ryle says is helpful, though some of it reflects the prevailing ideas of his times and is less useful now (e.g., his ambivalence towards the use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_purism_in_English">“Saxon words” in English</a>). Though I recommend you <a href="http://books.google.ca/books/about/Simplicity_in_preaching_a_few_short_hint.html?id=MgkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y">read the whole thing</a>, here are five directives Ryle gives to those who would attain simplicity in preaching:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have a clear knowledge of what you are going to preach.</li>
<li>Use simple words.</li>
<li>Seek to acquire a simple style of composition, with short sentences and as few colons and semi-colons as possible.</li>
<li>Aim at directness.</li>
<li>Make abundant use of illustration and anecdote.</li>

	<id>http://duncanjohnson.ca/blog/2014/04/05/timeline-of-old-testament-israel</id>
	<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I am making available a project that I’ve only recently begun. This project had its genesis a few years back when I created a <a href="http://duncanjohnson.ca/Isaiah-Visualizations/">timeline of events relevant to the Old Testament book of Isaiah</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, I took that work and expanded it into something I’ve had in mind for a while—a more comprehensive <a href="http://duncanjohnson.ca/OT-Timeline/">timeline of the history of Israel</a>. Right now, this only covers Old Testament Israel from the reign of Saul to the post-exilic period, and the details are sparse in some periods and heavy in others (esp. during the period of Isaiah’s life). There are many more things I’d like to do with this later, but I thought I’d make what I have so far available, especially since it’s relevant to the class I’m teaching right now on the Old Testament Historical Books.</p>]]></content>
