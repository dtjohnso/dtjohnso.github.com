Hi, my name is Duncan. I'm a Canadian expat (hailing from Edmonton and previously Victoria) living deep in Tarheel country. 

On this site I write about religious history, Christian theology, biblical exegesis, and technology. In tech, I mostly dabble in front-end web development and home automation.

I also use this site to link together some of my various online [projects](/projects/). I've taught courses on the Bible and theology in a number of settings, and much of that work is described on my [teaching](/teaching/) page.
