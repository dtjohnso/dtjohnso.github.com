![Duncan Johnson]({{site.url}}/images/branding/duncan-white-200x200.jpg){:style="float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"} Hi, my name is Duncan. I'm a Canadian expat (hailing from Edmonton and previously Victoria) living deep in Tarheel country. 

On this site I write about religious history, Christian theology, biblical exegesis, and technology. In tech, I mostly dabble in front-end web development and home automation.

I also use this site to link together some of my various online [projects](/projects/). I've taught courses on the Bible and theology in a number of settings, and much of that work is described on my [teaching](/teaching/) page.
