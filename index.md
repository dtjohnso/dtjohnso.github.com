<span style="white-space:nowrap;">Hi, my name is Duncan.</span> I'm a Canadian expat (hailing from Edmonton and previously Victoria) living deep in Tarheel country.

I used to write blog posts here, but eventually lost interest in the hobby and have removed almost all of my old posts. Only a few moderately evergreen posts are still up here now... at least until I get tired of them and delete them too.

I also use this site to link together some of my various online [projects](/projects/). I've taught courses on the Bible and theology in a number of settings, and much of that work is described on my [teaching](/teaching/) page.
